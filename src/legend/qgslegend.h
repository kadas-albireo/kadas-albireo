/**
   \class QgsLegend
   \brief A Legend treeview for QGIS
   Map legend is a specialised QListView designed to show grooups of map layers,
   map layers, and the map layer members, properties and symbols for each layer.

   The legend supports simple operations such as displaying an ordered list of 
   layers in the current canvas, and complex operations such as drag/dropping 
   layer symbologies and properties between layers. 

   There are a variety of different items that can appear in a QgsLegend. All 
   items added to a QgsLegend should be inherited from QgsLegendItem as this
   will ensure that they can perform legend specific tasks such as seeing if
   dropping of other items onto them is allowed, returning their type etc.

   The following types are defined:
   <ul>
   <li>QgsLegendGroup - a group folder for many layers (can include other groups)</li>
   <li>QgsLegendLayer - a layer that contains one or more files associated with it. 
                        allowing more than one file lets you create virtual layers where
                        1 or more files can share the same symbology and properties
                        and be treated as they are one layer for things such as hiding / 
                        showing, scale dependent visibility etc.</li>
   <li>QgsLegendSymbologyGroup - a collabsable node that contains symbology items. Can
                                only exist inside of a QgsLegendLayer</li>
   <li>QgsLegendSymbologyItem - a class break (vector) or pallette entry (raster) etc. 
                                Double clicking on a symbology item will let you change
                                the properties for only that specific item. Can only exist
                                inside a symbology group.</li>
   <li>QgsLegendPropertyGroup - a collapsable node that shows 1 or more properties. Can
                                only exist inside of a QgsLegendLayer</li>
   <li>QgsLegendPropertyItem - A list of properties related to the layer. Double clicking
                              a property item will invoke a dialog that will let you change
                              the property settings. Can only exist inside a property group</li>
   <li>QgsLegendLayerFileGroup - each QgsLegendLayer can have one or more files associated
                              with it. This is the container group for these files. Can
                              only exist inside of a QgsLegendLayer.</li>
   <li>QgsLegendLayerFile -  A file node that relates to a file on disk. Assigning multiple
                             file nodes in a file group allows you treat them as if they are
                             one entity.</li>
   </ul>
   @note Additional group types may be defined in the future to accommodate WMS, PostGIS etc layers.
