Spatial indexing is based on code by Marios Hadjieleftheriou, who has
developed spatial index library and published it under GNU GPL.

This code is based on version 1.6.1 of the library which can be found here:
http://download.osgeo.org/libspatialindex/spatialindex-src-1.6.1.tar.gz

There are only few differences from the original libraries, namely:
- MVR-tree, TPR-tree and their variants of Point and Region were removed
- some warnings fixed (i<0 for unsigned, unreferenced arguments)
- reindentation
