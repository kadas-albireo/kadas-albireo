/**

  \brief QGIS internal clipboard for features.

  An internal clipboard is required so that features can be retained in
  their original fidelity.

  The internal clipboard makes a copy of features that are presented to it,
  therefore the original objects can safely be destructed independent of
  the lifetime of the internal clipboard.

  As this class matures it should also be able to accept CSV repesentations
  of features in and out of the system clipboard (QClipboard).
