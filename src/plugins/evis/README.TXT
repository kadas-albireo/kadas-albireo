eVis - The Event Visualization Tool

Lead Developer: Peter J. Ersts
Concept and original documentation: Ned Horning and Kevin Koy

This plugin was originally written and distributed by the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation's Biodiversity Informtics Facility at the American Museum of Natural History -

eVis was contributed to the QGIS project on 2009-07-01.

eVis was started in 2007 with QGIS v0.7.0. It was our first experience with QGIS and QT. Since its early beginings, the QGIS API has under gone many changes and advances, and as a result there are still some old ideas in this code and much room for improvement. Were we to start this plugin now, we would have done it quite differently! There is still much room for imporovement. We hope the QGIS community will find eVis useful and extend its capabilities to make it even more robust.



A special "thank you" is extended to the following people who have contributed translations, comments, bug reports, and patches which have helped to make eVis a better tool:
Tim Sutton, Magnus Homann, John Tull, Agustin Lobo, Donald Schrupp, Muslim Bandishoev, Anousak Souphavanh, Ha Quy Quynh, Roberto Garc√≠a-Yunta, Tom Gottfried
