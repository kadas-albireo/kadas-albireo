 DXF2SHP Plugin converter

We've just developed and partially tested this plugin that converts a DXF file
into one or more vector layers in QGIS;  it can also extract labels from the
DXF file and inserts the data (string, x, y, z, angle) in the dbf file of a new
point layer populated with points located where the labels should be rendered.
The purpose is to let Mapserver render them.

The plugin uses shapelib and dxflib to convert and create the shp files.
