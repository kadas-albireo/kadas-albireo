   *
   * Using these flags for all modal dialogs throughout QGIS ensures that
   * for platforms such as the Mac where modal and modeless dialogs have
   * different looks, QGIS modal dialogs will look the same as Qt modal
   * dialogs and all modal dialogs will look distinct from modeless dialogs.
   * Althought not the standard Mac modal look, it does lack the minimize
   * control which makes sense only for modeless dislogs.
   *
   * The Qt3 method of creating a true Mac modal dialog is deprecated in Qt4
   * and should not be used due to conflicts with QMessageBox style dialogs.
   *
   * Qt::WindowMaximizeButtonHint is included but will be ignored if
   * the dialog is a fixed size and does not have a size grip.
