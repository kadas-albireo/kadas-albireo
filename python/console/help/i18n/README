You can contribute to translate this help by creating a file *.properties and name it in
<your_locale_name>.properties
To get your locale name type the following lines in console:

>>> from PyQt4.QtCore import *
>>> QLocale.system().name()

For example: for Italian translation copy and paste a *.properties file and rename it to "it_IT.properties".
The only thing what you have to do is translate the values of the keys in dictionary.

i18n_dict = {
"key" : "value"
}
