/*
 This is NOT a proper c++ source code. This file is only designed to be catched
 by qmake and included to lupdate. It contains all translateable strings copied
 from the python files:
   installer_data.py
   installer_plugin.py
   installer_gui.py

 Please keep the python files and this file synchronized. I hope we'll find
 a more automated way to put PyQt strings to the qgis_*.ts files some day.
