<h1 class='module'>D8 Contributing Area</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>Calculates a grid of contributing areas using the
single direction D8 flow model. The contribution of each grid cell is taken
as one (or when the optional weight grid is used, the value from the weight
grid). The contributing area for each grid cell is taken as its own contribution
plus the contribution from upslope neighbors that drain in to it according
to the D8 flow model.</div>
<div class='description'>If the optional outlet point shapefile is used,
only the outlet cells and the cells upslope (by the D8 flow model) of them
are in the domain to be evaluated.</div>
<div class='description'>By default, the tool checks for edge contamination.
This is defined as the possibility that a contributing area value may be
underestimated due to grid cells outside of the domain not being counted.
This occurs when drainage is inwards from the boundaries or areas with
&quot;no data&quot; values for elevation. The algorithm recognizes this
and reports &quot;no data&quot; for the contributing area. It is common
to see streaks of &quot;no data&quot; values extending inwards from boundaries
along flow paths that enter the domain at a boundary. This is the desired
effect and indicates that contributing area for these grid cells is unknown
due to it being dependent on terrain outside of the domain of data available.
Edge contamination checking may be turned off in cases where you know this
is not an issue or want to ignore these problems, if for example, the DEM
has been clipped along a watershed outline.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>D8 Flow Direction Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of D8 flow directions which are defined, for each cell, as
    the direction of the one of its eight adjacent or diagonal neighbors
    with the steepest downward slope. This grid can be obtained as the
    output of the &quot;D8 Flow Directions&quot; tool.</dd>
  <dt>Outlets Shapefile <div class='type'>Point Shapefile (optional)</div></dt>
    <dd>A point shapefile defining the outlets of interest. If this input
    file is used, only the cells upslope of these outlet cells are considered
    to be within the domain being evaluated.</dd>
  <dt>Weight Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid (optional)</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid giving contribution to flow for each cell. These contributions
    (also sometimes referred to as weights or loadings) are used in the
    contributing area accumulation. If this input file is not used, the
    contribution to flow will assumed to be one for each grid cell.</dd>
  <dt>Check for edge contamination <div class='type'>Boolean</div></dt>
    <dd>A flag that indicates whether the tool should check for edge
    contamination. Edge contamination is defined as the possibility that
    a contributing area value may be underestimated due to the fact that
    grid cells outside of the domain have not been evaluated. This occurs
    when drainage is inwards from the boundaries or areas with &quot;no data&quot;
    values for elevation. The algorithm recognizes this and reports &quot;no data&quot;
    for the impated cells. It is common to see streaks of &quot;no data&quot;
    values extending inwards from boundaries along flow paths that enter
    the domain at a boundary. This is the desired effect and indicates that
    contributing area for these grid cells is unknown due to it being
    dependent on terrain outside of the domain of available data. Edge
    contamination checking may be turned off in cases where you know this
    is not an issue, or want to ignore these problems, if for example, the
    DEM has been clipped along a watershed outline.</dd>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>D8 Contributing Area Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of contributing area values calculated as the cells own
    contribution plus the contribution from upslope neighbors that drain
    in to it according to the D8 flow model.</dd>
