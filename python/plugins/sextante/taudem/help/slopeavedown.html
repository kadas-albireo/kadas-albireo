<h1 class='module'>Slope Average Down</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>This tool computes slope in a D8 downslope direction
averaged over a user selected distance. Distance should be specified in
horizontal map units.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>D8 Flow Direction Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This input is a grid of flow directions that are encoded using the
    D8 method where all flow from a cells goes to a single neighboring cell
    in the direction of steepest descent.This grid can be obtained as the
    output of the &quot;D8 Flow Directions&quot; tool.</dd>
  <dt>Pit Filled Elevation Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This input is a grid of elevation values. As a general rule, it is
    recommended that you use a grid of elevation values that have had the
    pits removed for this input. Pits are generally taken to be artifacts
    that interfere with the analysis of flow across them. This grid can be
    obtained as the output of the &quot;Pit Remove&quot; tool, in which case
    it contains elevation values where the pits have been filled to the
    point where they just drain.</dd>
  <dt>Downslope Distance <div class='type'>Double</div></dt>
    <dd>Input parameter of downslope distance over which to calculate the
    slope (in horizontal map units). Default <strong>50</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Slope Average Down Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This output is a grid of slopes calculated in the D8 downslope
    direction, averaged over the selected distance.</dd>
</dl>
