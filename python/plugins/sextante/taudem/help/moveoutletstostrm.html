<h1 class='module'>Move Outlets To Streams</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>Moves outlet points that are not aligned with a
stream cell from a stream raster grid, downslope along the D8 flow direction
until a stream raster cell is encountered, the &quot;max_dist&quot; number
of grid cells are examined, or the flow path exits the domain (i.e. a
&quot;no data&quot; value is encountered for the D8 flow direction). The
output file is a new outlets shapefile where each point has been moved to
coincide with the stream raster grid, if possible. A field &quot;dist_moved&quot;
is added to the new outlets shapefile to indicate the changes made to each
point. Points that are already on a stream cell are not moved and their
&quot;dist_moved&quot; field is assigned a value 0. Points that are initially
not on a stream cell are moved by sliding them downslope along the D8 flow
direction until one of the following occurs: a) A stream raster grid cell
is encountered before traversing the max_dist number of grid cells. In
which case, the point is moved and the &quot;dist_moved&quot; field is
assigned a value indicating how many grid cells the point was moved.
b) More than the max_number of grid cells are traversed, or c) the traversal
ends up going out of the domain (i.e., a &quot;no data&quot; D8 flow direction
value is encountered). In which case, the point is not moved and the
&quot;dist_moved&quot; field is assigned a value of -1.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>D8 Flow Direction Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of D8 flow directions which are defined, for each cell, as
    the direction of the one of its eight adjacent or diagonal neighbors
    with the steepest downward slope. This grid can be obtained as the
    output of the &quot;D8 Flow Directions&quot; tool.</dd>
  <dt>Stream Raster Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This output is an indicator grid (1, 0) that indicates the location
    of streams, with a value of 1 for each of the stream cells and 0 for
    the remainder of the cells. This file is produced by several different
    tools in the &quot;Stream Network Analysis&quot; toolset.</dd>
  <dt>Outlets Shapefile <div class='type'>Point Shapefile</div></dt>
    <dd>A point shape file defining points of interest or outlets that
    should ideally be located on a stream, but may not be exactly on the
    stream due to the fact that the shapefile point locations may not have
    been accurately registered with respect to the stream raster grid.</dd>
  <dt>Maximum Number of Grid Cells to traverse <div class='type'>Double</div></dt>
    <dd>This input paramater is the maximum number of grid cells that the
    points in the input outlet shapefile will be moved before they are saved
    to the output outlet shapefile. Default is <strong>50</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Output Outlet Shapefile <div class='type'>Point Shapefile</div></dt>
    <dd>A point shape file defining points of interest or outlets. This file
    has one point in it for each point in the input outlet shapefile. If
    the original point was located on a stream, then the point was not moved.
    If the origianl point was not on a stream, the point was moved downslope
    according to the D8 flow direction until it reached a stream or the
    maximum distance had been reached. This file has an additional field
    &quot;dist_moved&quot; added to it which is the number of cells that
    the point was moved. This field is 0 if the cell was originally on a
    stream, -1 if it was not moved becuase there was not a stream within
    the maximum distance, or some positive value if it was moved.</dd>
