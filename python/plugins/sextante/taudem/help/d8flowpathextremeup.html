<h1 class='module'>D8 Extreme Upslope Value</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>Evaluates the extreme (either maximum or minimum)
upslope value from an input grid based on the D8 flow model. This is intended
initially for use in stream raster generation to identify a threshold of
the slope times area product that results in an optimum (according to drop
analysis) stream network.</div>
<div class='description'>If the optional outlet point shapefile is used,
only the outlet cells and the cells upslope (by the D8 flow model) of them
are in the domain to be evaluated.</div>
<div class='description'>By default, the tool checks for edge contamination.
This is defined as the possibility that a result may be underestimated due
to grid cells outside of the domain not being counted. This occurs when
drainage is inwards from the boundaries or areas with no data values for
elevation. The algorithm recognizes this and reports &quot;no data&quot;
for the result for these grid cells. It is common to see streaks of
&quot;no data&quot; values extending inwards from boundaries along flow
paths that enter the domain at a boundary. This is the desired effect and
indicates that the result for these grid cells is unknown due to it being
dependent on terrain outside of the domain of data available. Edge
contamination checking may be turned off in cases where you know this is
not an issue or want to ignore these problems, if for example, the DEM has
been clipped along a watershed outline.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>D8 Flow Direction Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of D8 flow directions which are defined, for each cell, as
    the direction of the one of its eight adjacent or diagonal neighbors
    with the steepest downward slope. This grid can be obtained as the
    output of the &quot;D8 Flow Directions&quot; tool.</dd>
  <dt>Upslope Values Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This is the grid of values of which the maximum or minimum upslope
    value is selected. The values most commonly used are the slope times
    area product needed when generating stream rasters according to drop
    analysis.</dd>
  <dt>Outlets Shapefile <div class='type'>Point Shapefile (optional)</div></dt>
    <dd>A point shape file defining outlets of interest. If this input file
    is used, only the area upslope of these outlets will be evaluated by
    the tool.</dd>
  <dt>Use maximum upslope value <div class='type'>Boolean</div></dt>
    <dd>A flag to indicate whether the maximum or minimum upslope value
    is to be calculated. Default is <strong>True</strong>.</dd>
  <dt>Check for edge contamination <div class='type'>Boolean</div></dt>
    <dd>A flag that indicates whether the tool should check for edge
    contamination. Default is <strong>True</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Extreme Value Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of the maximum/minimum upslope values.</dd>
