<h1 class='module'>Length Area Stream Source</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>Creates an indicator grid (1, 0) that evaluates
<tt>A >= (M)(L<sup>y</sup>)</tt> based on upslope path length, D8 contributing area
grid inputs, and parameters <tt>M</tt> and <tt>y</tt>. This grid indicates
likely stream source grid cells. This is an experimental method with
theoretical basis in Hack's law which states that for streams <tt>L ~ A<sup>0.6</sup></tt>.
However for hillslopes with parallel flow <tt>L ~ A</tt>. So a transition
from hillslopes to streams may be represented by <tt>L ~ A<sup>0.8</sup></tt>
suggesting identifying grid cells as stream cells if
<tt>A > M (L<sup>(1/0.8)</sup>)</tt>.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>Length Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of the maximum upslope length for each cell. This is calculated
    as the length of the flow path from the furthest cell that drains to each
    cell. Length is measured between cell centers taking into account cell
    size and whether the direction is adjacent or diagonal. It is this
    length (<tt>L</tt>) that is used in the formula, A >(M)(L<sup>y</sup>),
    to determine which cells are considered stream cells. This grid can
    be obtained as an output from the &quot;Grid Network&quot; tool.</dd>
  <dt>Contributing Area Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of contributing area values for each cell that were calculated
    using the D8 algorithm. The contributing area for a cell is the sum of
    its own contribution plus the contribution from all upslope neighbors
    that drain to it, measured as a number of cells. This grid is typically
    obtained as the output of the &quot;D8 Contributing Area&quot; tool.
    In this tool, it is the contributing area (<tt>A</tt>) that is compared
    in the formula <tt>A > (M)(L<sup>y</sup>)</tt> to determine the transition
    to a stream.</dd>
  <dt>Threshold <div class='type'>Double</div></dt>
    <dd>The multiplier threshold (<tt>M</tt>) parameter which is used in
    the formula: <tt>A > (M)(L<sup>y</sup>)</tt>, to identify the beginning
    of streams. Default value <strong>0.03</strong>.</dd>
  <dt>Exponent <div class='type'>Double</div></dt>
    <dd>The exponent (<tt>y</tt>) parameter which is used in the formula:
    A > (M)(L<sup>y</sup>), to identify the beginning of streams. In
    branching systems, Hack's law suggests that <tt>L = 1/M A<sup>(1/y)</sup></tt>
    with <tt>1/y = 0.6</tt> (or 0.56) (<tt>y</tt> about 1.7). In parallel
    flow systems <tt>L</tt> is proportional to <tt>A</tt> (<tt>y</tt> about 1).
    This method tries to identify the transition between these two paradigms
    by using an exponent <tt>y</tt> somewhere in between (<tt>y</tt> about 1.3).
    Default value <strong>1.3</strong>.</dd>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Slope Area Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of slope-area values = <tt>(S<sup>m</sup>)(A<sup>n</sup>)</tt>
    calculated from the slope grid, specific catchment area grid, <tt>m</tt>
    slope exponent parameter, and <tt>n</tt> area exponent parameter.</dd>
