<h1 class='module'>D-Infinity Distance Up</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>This tool calculates the distance from each grid
cell up to the ridge cells along the reverse D-infinity flow directions.
Ridge cells are defined to be grid cells that have no contribution from
grid cells further upslope. Given the convergence of multiple flow paths
at any grid cell, any given grid cell can have multiple upslope ridge cells.
There are three statictical methods that this tool can use: maximum distance,
minimum distance and waited flow average over these flow paths. A variant
on the above is to consider only grid cells that contribute flow with a
proportion greater than a user specified threshold (t) to be considered
as upslope of any given grid cell. Setting t=0.5 would result in only one
flow path from any grid cell and would give the result equivalent to a D8
flow model, rather than D-infinity flow model, where flow is proportioned
between two downslope grid cells. Finally there are several different
optional paths that can be measured: the total straight line path (Pythagoras),
the horizontal component of the straight line path, the vertical component
of the straight line path, or the total surface flow path.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>D-Infinity Flow Direction Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid giving flow direction by the D-infinity method. Flow direction
    is measured in radians, counter clockwise from east. This can be created
    by the tool &quot;D-Infinity Flow Directions&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>Pit Filled Elevation Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This input is a grid of elevation values. As a general rule, it is
    recommended that you use a grid of elevation values that have had the
    pits removed for this input. Pits are generally taken to be artifacts
    that interfere with the analysis of flow across them. This grid can be
    obtained as the output of the &quot;Pit Remove&quot; tool, in which case
    it contains elevation values where the pits have been filled to the
    point where they just drain.</dd>
  <dt>Slope Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This input is a grid of slope values. This is measured as drop/distance
    and it is most often obtained as the output of the &quot;D-Infinity
    Flow Directions&quot; tool.</dd>
  <dt>Statistical Method <div class='type'>Choise</div></dt>
    <dd>Statistical method used to calculate the distance down to the stream.
    In the D-Infinity flow model, the outflow from each grid cell is
    proportioned between two downslope grid cells. Therefore, the distance
    from any grid cell to a stream is not uniquely defined. Flow that
    originates at a particular grid cell may enter the stream at a number
    of cells. The distance to the stream may be defined as the longest (maximum),
    shortest (minimum) or weighted average of the distance down to the stream.
    Default is <strong>Average</strong>.</dd>
  <dt>Distance Method <div class='type'>Choise</div></dt>
    <dd>Distance method used to calculate the distance down to the stream.
    One of several ways of measuring distance may be selected: the total
    straight line path (Pythagoras), the horizontal component of the straight
    line path (horizontal), the vertical component of the straight line path
    (vertical), or the total surface flow path (surface). Default is
    <strong>Horizontal</strong>.</dd>
  <dt>Proportion Threshold <div class='type'>Double</div></dt>
    <dd>The proportion threshold parameter where only grid cells that
    contribute flow with a proportion greater than this user specified
    threshold (t) is considered to be upslope of any given grid cell.
    Setting t=0.5 would result in only one flow path from any grid cell
    and would give the result equivalent to a D8 flow model, rather than
    D-Infinity flow model, where flow is proportioned between two downslope
    grid cells. Default <strong>0.5</strong>.</dd>
  <dt>Check for Edge Contamination <div class='type'>Boolean</div></dt>
    <dd>A flag that determines whether the tool should check for edge
    contamination. This is defined as the possibility that a value may be
    underestimated due to grid cells outside of the domain not being counted.
    Default <strong>True</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>D-Infinity Distance Up <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>Creates a grid containing the distances up to the ridge calculated
    using the D-Infinity flow model and the statistical and path methods
    chosen.</dd>
</dl>
