<h1 class='module'>D8 Distance To Streams</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>Computes the horizontal distance to stream for
each grid cell, moving downslope according to the D8 flow model, until a
stream grid cell is encountered.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>D8 Flow Direction Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This input is a grid of flow directions that are encoded using the
    D8 method where all flow from a cells goes to a single neighboring cell
    in the direction of steepest descent. This grid can be obtained as the
    output of the &quot;D8 Flow Directions&quot; tool.</dd>
  <dt>Stream Raster Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid indicating streams. Such a grid can be created by several
    of the tools in the &quot;Stream Network Analysis&quot; toolset. However,
    the tools in the &quot;Stream Network Analysis&quot; toolset only create
    grids with a value of 0 for no stream, or 1 for stream cells. This tool
    can also accept grids with values greater than 1, which can be used in
    conjunction with the Threshold parameter to determine the location of
    streams. This allows Contributing Area grids to be used to define streams
    as well as the normal Stream Raster grids. This grid expects integer
    (long integer) values and any non-integer values will be truncated to an
    integer before being evaluated.</dd>
  <dt>Threshold <div class='type'>Double</div></dt>
    <dd>This value acts as threshold on the Stream Raster Grid to determine
    the location of streams. Cells with a Stream Raster Grid value greater
    than or equal to the Threshold value are interpreted as streams. Default
    value <strong>50</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Distance to Streams <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid giving the horizontal distance along the flow path as defined
    by the D8 Flow Directions Grid to the streams in the Stream Raster Grid.</dd>
</dl>
