<h1 class='module'>D-Infinity Avalanche Runout</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>Identifies an avalanche's affected area and the
flow path length to each cell in that affacted area. All cells downslope
from each source area cell, up to the point where the slope from the source
to the affected area is less than a threshold angle called the Alpha Angle
can be in the affected area. This tool uses the D-infinity multiple flow
direction method for determining flow direction. This will likely cause
very small amounts of flow to be dispersed to some downslope cells that
might overstate the affected area, so a threshold proportion can be set
to avoid this excess dispersion. The flow path length is the distance from
the cell in question to the source cell that has the highest angle.</div>
<div class='description'>All points downslope from the source area are
potentially in the affected area, but not beyond a point where the slope
from the source to the affected area is less than a threshold angle called
the Alpha Angle.</div>
<p align="center"><img src="img/arexample.gif"></img></p>
<div class='description'>Slope is to be measured using the straight line
distance from source point to evaluation point.</div>
<div class='description'>It makes more physical sense to me for the angle
to be measured along the flow path. Nevertheless it is equally easy to
code straight line angles as angles along the flow path, so an option that
allows switching will be provided. The most practical way to evaluate
avalanche runout is to keep track of the source point with the greatest
angle to each point. Then the recursive upslope flow algebra approach will
look at a grid cell and all its upslope neighbors that flow to it. Information
from the upslope neighbors will be used to calculate the angle to the grid
cell in question and retain it in the runout zone if the angle exceeds
the alpha angle. This procedure makes the assumption that the maximum
angle at a grid cell will be from the set of cells that have maximum angles
to the inflowing neighbors. This will always be true of angle is calculated
along a flow path, but I can conceive of cases where flow paths bend back
on themselves where this would not be the case for straight line angles.</div>
<div class='description'>The D-infinity multiple flow direction field assigns
flow from each grid cell to multiple downslope neighbors using proportions
(<tt>P<sub>ik</sub></tt>) that vary between 0 and 1 and sum to 1 for all
flows out of a grid cell. It may be desirable to specify a threshold <tt>T</tt>
that this proportion has to exceed before a grid cell is counted as flowing
to a downslope grid cell, e.g. <tt>P<sub>ik</sub> > T</tt> (=0.2 say) to
avoid dispersion to grid cells that get very little flow. <tt>T</tt> will
be specified as a user input. If all upslope grid cells are to be used
<tt>T</tt> may be input as 0.</div>
<div class='description'>Avalanche source sites are to be input as a short
integer grid (name suffix *ass, e.g. demass) comprised of positive values
where avalanches may be triggered and 0 values elsewhere.</div>
<div class='description'>The following grids are output:</div>
<ul>
  <li>rz&nbsp;&mdash; A runout zone indicator with value 0 to indicate that
  this grid cell is not in the runout zone and value > 0 to indicate that
  this grid cell is in the runout zone. Since there may be information in
  the angle to the associated source site, this variable will be assigned
  the angle to the source site (in degrees)</li>
  <li>dm&nbsp;&mdash; Along flow distance from the source site that has
  the highest angle to the point in question</li>
</ul>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>D-Infinity Flow Direction Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid giving flow direction by the D-infinity method. Flow direction
    is measured in radians, counter clockwise from east. This can be created
    by the tool &quot;D-Infinity Flow Directions&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>Pit Filled Elevation Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This input is a grid of elevation values. As a general rule, it is
    recommended that you use a grid of elevation values that have had the
    pits removed for this input. Pits are generally taken to be artifacts
    that interfere with the analysis of flow across them. This grid can be
    obtained as the output of the &quot;Pit Remove&quot; tool, in which case
    it contains elevation values where the pits have been filled to the
    point where they just drain.</dd>
  <dt>Avalanche Source Site Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This is a grid of source areas for snow avalanches that are commonly
    identified manually using a mix of experience and visual interpretation
    of maps. Avalanche source sites are to be input as a short integer grid
    (name suffix *ass, e.g. demass) comprised of positive values where
    avalanches may be triggered and 0 values elsewhere.</dd>
  <dt>Proportion Threshold <div class='type'>Double</div></dt>
    <dd>This value is a threshold proportion that is used to limit the disperson
    of flow caused by using the D-infinity multiple flow direction method
    for determining flow direction. The D-infinity multiple flow direction
    method often causes very small amounts of flow to be dispersed to some
    downslope cells that might overstate the affected area, so a threshold
    proportion can be set to avoid this excess dispersion. Default <strong>0.2</strong>.</dd>
  <dt>Alpha Angle Threshold <div class='type'>Double</div></dt>
    <dd>This value is the threshold angle, called the Alpha Angle, that
    is used to determine which of the cells downslope from the source cells
    are in the affected area. Only the cells downslope from each source
    area cell, up to the point where the slope from the source to the
    affected area is less than a threshold angle are in the affected area.
    Default <strong>18</strong>.</dd>
  <dt>Measure distance along flow path <div class='type'>Boolean</div></dt>
    <dd>This option selects the method used to measure the distance used
    to calculate the slope angle. If option is &quot;True&quot; then measure
    it along the flow path, where the &quot;False&quot; option causes the
    slope to be measure along the straight line distance from the source
    cell to the evaluation cell. Default <strong>True</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Runout Zone Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This grid Identifies the avalanche's runout zone (affected area)
    using a runout zone indicator with value 0 to indicate that this grid
    cell is not in the runout zone and value > 0 to indicate that this grid
    cell is in the runout zone. Since there may be information in the angle
    to the associated source site, this variable will be assigned the angle
    to the source site (in degrees).</dd>
  <dt>Path Distance Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This is a grid of the flow distance from the source site that has
    the highest angle to each cell.</dd>
</dl>
