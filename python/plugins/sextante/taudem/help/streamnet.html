<h1 class='module'>Stream Reach And Watershed</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>This tool produces a vector network and shapefile
from the stream raster grid. The flow direction grid is used to connect
flow paths along the stream raster. The Strahler order of each stream
segment is computed. The subwatershed draining to each stream segment
(reach) is also delineated and labeled with the value identifier that
corresponds to the WSNO (watershed number) attribute in the Stream Reach
Shapefile.</div>
<div class='description'>This tool orders the stream network according to
the Strahler ordering system. Streams that don't have any other streams
draining in to them are order 1. When two stream reaches of different order
join the order of the downstream reach is the order of the highest incoming
reach. When two reaches of equal order join the downstream reach order is
increased by 1. When more than two reaches join the downstream reach order
is calculated as the maximum of the highest incoming reach order or the
second highest incoming reach order + 1. This generalizes the common
definition to cases where more than two reaches join at a point. The network
topological connectivity is stored in the Stream Network Tree file, and
coordinates and attributes from each grid cell along the network are stored
in the Network Coordinates file.</div>
<div class='description'>The stream raster grid is used as the source for
the stream network, and the flow direction grid is used to trace connections
within the stream network. Elevations and contributing area are used to
determine the elevation and contributing area attributes in the network
coordinate file. Points in the outlets shapefile are used to logically
split stream reaches to facilitate representing watersheds upstream and
downstream of monitoring points. The program uses the attribute field &quot;id&quot;
in the outlets shapefile as identifiers in the Network Tree file. This tool
then translates the text file vector network representation in the Network
Tree and Coordinates files into a shapefile. Further attributes are also
evaluated. The program has an option to delineate a single watershed by
representing the entire area draining to the Stream Network as a single
value in the output watershed grid.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>Pit Filled Elevation Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of elevation values. This is usually the output of the &quot;Pit
    Remove&quot; tool, in which case it is elevations with pits removed.</dd>
  <dt>D8 Flow Direction Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of D8 flow directions which are defined, for each cell, as
    the direction of the one of its eight adjacent or diagonal neighbors
    with the steepest downward slope. This grid can be obtained as the
    output of the &quot;D8 Flow Directions&quot; tool.</dd>
  <dt>D8 Drainage Area Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid giving the contributing area value in terms of the number
    of grid cells (or the summation of weights) for each cell taken as its
    own contribution plus the contribution from upslope neighbors that drain
    in to it using the D8 algorithm. This is usually the output of the &quot;D8
    Contributing Area&quot; tool and is used to determine the contributing
    area attribute in the Network Coordinate file.</dd>
  <dt>Stream Raster Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>An indicator grid indicating streams, by using a grid cell value
    of 1 on streams and 0 off streams. Several of the &quot;Stream Network
    Analysis&quot; tools produce this type of grid. The Stream Raster Grid
    is used as the source for the stream network.</dd>
  <dt>Outlets Shapefile as Network Nodes <div class='type'>Point Shapefile (optional)</div></dt>
    <dd>A point shape file defining points of interest. If this file is used,
    the tool will only deliiniate the stream network upstream of these outlets.
    Additionally, points in the Outlets Shapefile are used to logically split
    stream reaches to facilitate representing watersheds upstream and downstream
    of monitoring points. This tool REQUIRES THAT THERE BE an integer attribute
    field &quot;id&quot; in the Outlets Shapefile, because the &quot;id&quot;
    values are used as identifiers in the Network Tree file.</dd>
  <dt>Delineate Single Watershed <div class='type'>Boolean</div></dt>
    <dd>This option causes the tool to delineate a single watershed by
    representing the entire area draining to the Stream Network as a single
    value in the output watershed grid. Otherwise a seperate watershed is
    delineated for each stream reach. Default is <strong>False</strong>
    (seperate watershed).</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Stream Order Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>The Stream Order Grid has cells values of streams ordered according
    to the Strahler order system. The Strahler ordering system defines order
    1 streams as stream reaches that don't have any other reaches draining
    in to them. When two stream reaches of different order join the order
    of the downstream reach is the order of the highest incoming reach.
    When two reaches of equal order join the downstream reach order is
    increased by 1. When more than two reaches join the downstream reach
    order is calculated as the maximum of the highest incoming reach order
    or the second highest incoming reach order + 1. This generalizes the
    common definition to cases where more than two flow paths reaches
    join at a point.</dd>
  <dt>Watershed Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This output grid identified each reach watershed with a unique ID
    number, or in the case where the delineate single watershed option was
    checked, the entire area draining to the stream network is identified
    with a single ID.</dd>
  <dt>Stream Reach Shapefile <div class='type'>Polyline Shapefile</div></dt>
    <dd>This output is a polyline shapefile giving the links in a stream
    network. The columns in the attribute table are:
    <ul>
      <li>LINKNO&nbsp;&mdash; Link Number. A unique number associated with
      each link (segment of channel between junctions). This is arbitrary
      and will vary depending on number of processes used</li>
      <li>DSLINKNO&nbsp;&mdash; Link Number of the downstream link. -1
      indicates that this does not exist</li>
      <li>USLINKNO1&nbsp;&mdash; Link Number of first upstream link. (-1
      indicates no link upstream, i.e. for a source link)</li>
      <li>USLINKNO2&nbsp;&mdash; Link Number of second upstream link. (-1
      indicates no second link upstream, i.e. for a source link or an internal
      monitoring point where the reach is logically split but the network
      does not bifurcate)</li>
      <li>DSNODEID&nbsp;&mdash; Node identifier for node at downstream end
      of stream reach. This identifier corresponds to the &quot;id&quot;
      attribute from the Outlets shapefile used to designate nodes</li>
      <li>Order&nbsp;&mdash; Strahler Stream Order</li>
      <li>Length&nbsp;&mdash; Length of the link. The units are the horizontal
      map units of the underlying DEM grid</li>
      <li>Magnitude&nbsp;&mdash; Shreve Magnitude of the link. This is the
      total number of sources upstream</li>
      <li>DS_Cont_Ar&nbsp;&mdash; Drainage area at the downstream end of
      the link. Generally this is one grid cell upstream of the downstream
      end because the drainage area at the downstream end grid cell includes
      the area of the stream being joined</li>
      <li>Drop&nbsp;&mdash; Drop in elevation from the start to the end
      of the link</li>
      <li>Slope&nbsp;&mdash; Average slope of the link (computed as drop/length)</li>

      most downstream point in the stream network) from the downstream end
      of the link</li>
      <li>DOUT_START&nbsp;&mdash; Distance to the eventual outlet from the
      upstream end of the link</li>
      <li>DOUT_MID&nbsp;&mdash; Distance to the eventual outlet from the
      midpoint of the link</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Link Number (Arbitrary&nbsp;&mdash; will vary depending on number
      of processes used)</li>
      <li>Start Point Number in Network coordinates (*coord.dat) file (Indexed
      from 0)</li>
      <li>End Point Number in Network coordinates (*coord.dat) file (Indexed
      from 0)</li>
      <li>Next (Downstream) Link Number. Points to Link Number. -1 indicates
      no links downstream, i.e. a terminal link</li>
      <li>First Previous (Upstream) Link Number. Points to Link Number. -1
      indicates no upstream links</li>
      <li>Second Previous (Upstream) Link Numbers. Points to Link Number. -1
      indicates no upstream links. Where only one previous link is -1, it
      indicates an internal monitoring point where the reach is logically
      split, but the network does not bifurcate</li>
      <li>Strahler Order of Link</li>
      <li>Monitoring point identifier at downstream end of link. -1 indicates
      downstream end is not a monitoring point</li>
