<h1 class='module'>D-Infinity Flow Directions</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>Assigns a flow direction based on the D-infinity
flow method using the steepest slope of a triangular facet (Tarboton, 1997,
&quot;A New Method for the Determination of Flow Directions and Contributing
Areas in Grid Digital Elevation Models&quot;, Water Resources Research,
33(2): 309-319). Flow direction is defined as steepest downward slope on
planar triangular facets on a block centered grid. Flow direction is encoded
as an angle in radians counter-clockwise from east as a continuous (floating
point) quantity between 0 and 2&pi;. The flow direction angle is determined
as the direction of the steepest downward slope on the eight triangular
facets formed in a 3 x 3 grid cell window centered on the grid cell of
interest. The resulting flow in a grid is then usually interpreted as being
proportioned between the two neighboring cells that define the triangular
facet with the steepest downward slope.</div>

<div class='description'>A block-centered representation is used with each
elevation value taken to represent the elevation of the center of the
corresponding grid cell. Eight planar triangular facets are formed between
each grid cell and its eight neighbors. Each of these has a downslope vector
which when drawn outwards from the center may be at an angle that lies within
or outside the 45 degree (&pi;/4 radian) angle range of the facet at the center
point. If the slope vector angle is within the facet angle, it represents
the steepest flow direction on that facet. If the slope vector angle is
outside a facet, the steepest flow direction associated with that facet
is taken along the steepest edge. The slope and flow direction associated
with the grid cell is taken as the magnitude and direction of the steepest
downslope vector from all eight facets. Slope is measured as drop/distance,
i.e. tan of the slope angle.</div>
<div class='description'>In the case where no slope vectors are positive
(downslope), the flow direction is set using the method of Garbrecht and
Martz (1997) for the determination of flow across flat areas. This makes
flat areas drain away from high ground and towards low ground. The flow
path grid to enforce drainage along existing streams is an optional input,
and if used, takes precedence over elevations for the setting of flow
directions.</div>
<div class='description'>The D-infinity flow direction algorithm may be
applied to a DEM that has not had its pits filled, but it will then result
in &quot;no data&quot; values for the D-infinity flow direction and slope
associated with the lowest point of the pit.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>Pit Filled Elevation Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of elevation values. This is usually the output of the
    &quot;Pit Remove&quot; tool, in which case it is elevations with pits
    removed.</dd>

    <dd>A grid of flow directions based on the D-infinity flow method using
    the steepest slope of a triangular facet. Flow direction is determined
    as the direction of the steepest downward slope on the 8 triangular
    facets of a 3 x 3 block centered grid. Flow direction is encoded as
    an angle in radians, counter-clockwise from east as a continuous
    (floating point) quantity between 0 and 2&pi;. The resulting flow in
    a grid is then usually interpreted as being proportioned between the
    two neighboring cells that define the triangular facet with the steepest

    <dd>A grid of slope evaluated using the D-infinity method described in
    Tarboton, D. G., (1997), &quot;A New Method for the Determination of
    Flow Directions and Contributing Areas in Grid Digital Elevation Models&quot;,
    Water Resources Research, 33(2): 309-319. This is the steepest outwards
    slope on one of eight triangular facets centered at each grid cell,
    measured as drop/distance, i.e. tan of the slope angle.</dd>
