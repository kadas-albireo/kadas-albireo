<div class='description'>Creates an indicator grid (1, 0) of upward curved
grid cells according to the Peuker and Douglas algorithm.</div>
<div class='description'>With this tool, the DEM is first smoothed by a
kernel with weights at the center, sides, and diagonals. The Peuker and
Douglas (1975) method (also explained in Band, 1986), is then used to
identify upwardly curving grid cells. This technique flags the entire grid,
then examines in a single pass each quadrant of 4 grid cells, and unflags
the highest. The remaining flagged cells are deemed &quot;upwardly curved&quot;,
and when viewed, resemble a channel network. This proto-channel network
generally lacks connectivity and requires thinning, issues that were
discussed in detail by Band (1986).</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>Elevation Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of elevation values. This is usually the output of the &quot;Pit
    Remove&quot; tool, in which case it is elevations with pits removed.</dd>
  <dt>Center Smoothing Weight <div class='type'>Double</div></dt>
    <dd>The center weight parameter used by a kernel to smooth the DEM
    before the tool identifies upwardly curved grid cells. Default value
    is <strong>0.4</strong>.</dd>
  <dt>Side Smoothing Weight <div class='type'>Double</div></dt>
    <dd>The side weight parameter used by a kernel to smooth the DEM before
    the tool identifies upwardly curved grid cells. Default value is
    <strong>0.1</strong>.</dd>
  <dt>Diagonal Smoothing Weight <div class='type'>Double</div></dt>
    <dd>The diagonal weight parameter used by a kernel to smooth the DEM
    before the tool identifies upwardly curved grid cells. Default value
    is <strong>0.05</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Stream Source Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>An indicator grid (1, 0) of upward curved grid cells according to
    the Peuker and Douglas algorithm, and if viewed, resembles a channel
    network. This proto-channel network generally lacks connectivity and
    requires thinning, issues that were discussed in detail by Band (1986).</dd>
