<h1 class='module'>Stream Definition By Threshold</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>Operates on any grid and outputs an indicator
(1, 0) grid identifing cells with input values >= the threshold value. The
standard use is to use an accumulated source area grid to as the input grid
to generate a stream raster grid as the output. If you use the optional
input mask grid, it limits the domain being evaluated to cells with mask
values >= 0. When you use a D-infinity contributing area grid (*sca) as
the mask grid, it functions as an edge contamination mask. The threshold
logic is:</div>
<pre align="center">src = ((ssa >= thresh) &amp; (mask >= s0)) ? 1:0</pre>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>Accumulated Stream Source Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This grid nominally accumulates some characteristic or combination
    of characteristics of the watershed. The exact characteristic(s) varies
    depending on the stream network raster algorithm being used. This grid
    needs to have the property that grid cell values are monotonically
    increasing downslope along D8 flow directions, so that the resulting
    stream network is continuous. While this grid is often from an accumulation,
    other sources such as a maximum upslope function will also produce a
    suitable grid.</dd>
  <dt>Mask Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid (optional)</div></dt>
    <dd>This optional input is a grid that is used to mask the domain of
    interest and output is only provided where this grid is >= 0. A common
    use of this input is to use a D-Infinity contributing area grid as the
    mask so that the delineated stream network is constrained to areas where
    D-infinity contributing area is available, replicating the functionality
    of an edge contamination mask.</dd>
  <dt>Threshold <div class='type'>Double</div></dt>
    <dd>This parameter is compared to the value in the Accumulated Stream
    Source grid (*ssa) to determine if the cell should be considered a stream
    cell. Streams are identified as grid cells for which ssa value is >=
    this threshold.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Stream Raster Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This is an indicator grid (1, 0) that indicates the location of
    streams, with a value of 1 for each of the stream cells and 0 for the
    remainder of the cells.</dd>
</dl>
