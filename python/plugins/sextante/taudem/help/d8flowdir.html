<h1 class='module'>D8 Flow Directions</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>Creates 2 grids. The first contains the flow
direction from each grid cell to one of its adjacent or diagonal neighbors,
calculated using the direction of steepest descent. The second contain the
slope, as evaluated in the direction of steepest descent, and is reported
as drop/distance, i.e. tan of the angle. Flow direction is reported as
&quot;no data&quot; for any grid cell adjacent to the edge of the DEM domain,
or adjacent to a &quot;no data&quot; value in the DEM. In flat areas, flow
directions are assigned away from higher ground and towards lower ground
using the method of Garbrecht and Martz (1997). The D8 flow direction
algorithm may be applied to a DEM that has not had its pits filled, but
it will then result in &quot;no data&quot; values for flow direction
and slope at the lowest point of each pit.</div>

<div class='description'>The flow direction routing across flat areas is
performed according to the method described by Garbrecht, J. and L. W.
Martz, (1997), &quot;The Assignment of Drainage Direction Over Flat Surfaces
in Raster Digital Elevation Models&quot;, Journal of Hydrology, 193: 204-213.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>Pit Filled Elevation Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of elevation values. This is usually the output of the &quot;Pit
    Remove&quot; tool, in which case it is elevations with pits removed.
    Pits are low elevation areas in digital elevation models (DEMs) that
    are completely surrounded by higher terrain. They are generally taken
    to be artifacts of the digitation process that interfere with the
    processing of flow across DEMs. So they are removed by raising their
    elevation to the point where they just drain off the domain. This step
    is not essential if you have reason to believe that the pits in your
    DEM are real. If a few pits actually exist and so should not be removed,
    while at the same time others are believed to be artifacts that need
    to be removed, the actual pits should have &quot;no data&quot; elevation
    values inserted at their lowest point. &quot;No data&quot; values serve
    to define edges of the domain in the flow field, and elevations are
    only raised to where flow is off an edge, so an internal &quot;no data&quot;
    value will stop a pit from being removed, if necessary.</dd>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>D8 Flow Direction Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of D8 flow directions which are defined, for each cell, as
    the direction of the one of its eight adjacent or diagonal neighbors
    with the steepest downward slope.</dd>
  <dt>D8 Slope Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid giving slope in the D8 flow direction. This is measured as
    drop/distance.</dd>
