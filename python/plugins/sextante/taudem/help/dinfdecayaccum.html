<h1 class='module'>D-Infinity Decaying Accumulation</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>The D-Infinity Decaying Accumulation tool creates
a grid of the accumulated quantity at each location in the domain where
the quantity accumulates with the D-infinity flow field, but is subject
to first order decay in moving from cell to cell. By default, the quantity
contribution of each grid cell is the cell length to give a per unit width
accumulation, but can optionally be expressed with a weight grid. The decay
multiplier grid gives the fractional (first order) reduction in quantity
in accumulating from grid cell <tt>x</tt> to the next downslope cell.</div>
<div class='description'>A decayed accumulation operator <tt>DA[.]</tt>
takes as input a mass loading field <tt>m(x)</tt> expressed at each grid
location as <tt>m(i, j)</tt> that is assumed to move with the flow field
but is subject to first order decay in moving from cell to cell. The output
is the accumulated mass at each location <tt>DA(x)</tt>. The accumulation
of <tt>m</tt> at each grid cell can be numerically evaluated.</div>
<p align="center"><img src="img/decayeqn.gif"></img></p>
<div class='description'>Here <tt>d(x) = d(i ,j)</tt> is a decay multiplier
giving the fractional (first order) reduction in mass in moving from grid
cell <tt>x</tt> to the next downslope cell. If travel (or residence) times
<tt>t(x)</tt> associated with flow between cells are available <tt>d(x)</tt>
may be evaluated as <tt>exp(-k t(x))</tt> where <tt>k</tt> is a first order
decay parameter. The weight grid is used to represent the mass loading <tt>m(x)</tt>.
If not specified this is taken as 1. If the outlets shapefile is used the
function is only evaluated on that part of the domain that contributes flow
to the locations given by the shapefile.</div>

<div class='description'>Useful for a tracking contaminant or compound
subject to decay or attenuation.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>D-Infinity Flow Direction Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid giving flow direction by the D-infinity method. Flow direction
    is measured in radians, counter clockwise from east. This grid can be
    created by the function &quot;D-Infinity Flow Directions&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>Decay Multiplier Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid giving the factor by which flow leaving each grid cell is
    multiplied before accumulation on downslope grid cells. This may be
    used to simulate the movement of an attenuating substance.</dd>
  <dt>Weight Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid (optional)</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid giving weights (loadings) to be used in the accumulation.
    If this optional grid is not specified, weights are taken as the linear
    grid cell size to give a per unit width accumulation.</dd>
  <dt>Outlets Shapefile <div class='type'>Point Shapefile (optional)</div></dt>
    <dd>This optional input is a point shapefile defining outlets of interest.
    If this file is used, the tool will only evaluate ther area upslope of
    these outlets.</dd>
  <dt>Check for edge contamination <div class='type'>Boolean</div></dt>
    <dd>This option determines whether the tool should check for edge
    contamination. Edge contamination is defined as the possibility that
    a value may be underestimated due to grid cells outside of the domain
    not being considered when determining contributing area. Default
    <strong>True</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Decayed Specific Catchment Area Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>The D-Infinity Decaying Accumulation tool creates a grid of the
    accumulated mass at each location in the domain where mass moves with
    the D-infinity flow field, but is subject to first order decay in moving
    from cell to cell.</dd>
