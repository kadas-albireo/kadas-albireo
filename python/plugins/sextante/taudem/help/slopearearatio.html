<h1 class='module'>Slope Over Area Ratio</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>Calculates the ratio of the slope to the specific
catchment area (contributing area). This is algebraically related to the
more common ln(a/tan beta) wetness index, but contributing area is in the
denominator to avoid divide by 0 errors when slope is 0.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>Slope Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of slope. This grid can be generated using ether the &quot;D8
    Flow Directions&quot; tool or the &quot;D-Infinity Flow Directions&quot;
    tool.</dd>
  <dt>Specific Catchment Area Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid giving the contributing area value for each cell taken as
    its own contribution plus the contribution from upslope neighbors that
    drain in to it. Contributing area is counted in terms of the number of
    grid cells (or summation of weights). This grid can be generated using
    either the &quot;D8 Contributing Area&quot; tool or the &quot;D-Infinity
    Contributing Area&quot; tool.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Slope Divided By Area Ratio Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of the ratio of slope to specific catchment area (contributing
    area). This is algebraically related to the more common <tt>ln(a/tan beta)</tt>
    wetness index, but contributing area is in the denominator to avoid divide
    by 0 errors when slope is 0.</dd>
