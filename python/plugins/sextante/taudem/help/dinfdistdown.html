<h1 class='module'>D-Infinity Distance Down</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>Calculates the distance downslope to a stream
using the D-infinity flow model. The D-infinity flow model is a multiple
flow direction model, because the outflow from each grid cell is proportioned
between up to 2 downslope grid cells. As such, the distance from any grid
cell to a stream is not uniquely defined. Flow that originates at a particular
grid cell may enter the stream at a number of different cells. The statistical
method may be selected as the longest, shortest or weighted average of the
flow path distance to the stream. Also one of several ways of measuring
distance may be selected: the total straight line path (Pythagoras), the
horizontal component of the straight line path, the vertical component of
the straight line path, or the total surface flow path.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>D-Infinity Flow Direction Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid giving flow direction by the D-infinity method. Flow direction
    is measured in radians, counter clockwise from east. This can be created
    by the tool &quot;D-Infinity Flow Directions&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>Pit Filled Elevation Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>This input is a grid of elevation values. As a general rule, it is
    recommended that you use a grid of elevation values that have had the
    pits removed for this input. Pits are generally taken to be artifacts
    that interfere with the analysis of flow across them. This grid can be
    obtained as the output of the &quot;Pit Remove&quot; tool, in which case
    it contains elevation values where the pits have been filled to the
    point where they just drain.</dd>
  <dt>Stream Raster Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid indicating streams, by using a grid cell value of 1 on streams
    and 0 off streams. This is usually the output of one of the tools in
    the &quot;Stream Network Analysis&quot; toolset.</dd>
  <dt>Weight Path Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid (optional)</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid giving weights (loadings) to be used in the distance calculation.
    This might be used for example where only flow distance through a buffer
    is to be calculated. The weight is then 1 in the buffer and 0 outside
    it. Alternatively the weight may reflect some sort of cost function
    for travel over the surface, perhaps representing travel time or attenuation
    of a process. If this input file is not used, the loadings will assumed
    to be one for each grid cell.</dd>
  <dt>Statistical Method <div class='type'>Choise</div></dt>
    <dd>Statistical method used to calculate the distance down to the stream.
    In the D-Infinity flow model, the outflow from each grid cell is
    proportioned between two downslope grid cells. Therefore, the distance
    from any grid cell to a stream is not uniquely defined. Flow that
    originates at a particular grid cell may enter the stream at a number
    of cells. The distance to the stream may be defined as the longest (maximum),
    shortest (minimum) or weighted average of the distance down to the stream.
    Default is <strong>Average</strong>.</dd>
  <dt>Distance Method <div class='type'>Choise</div></dt>
    <dd>Distance method used to calculate the distance down to the stream.
    One of several ways of measuring distance may be selected: the total
    straight line path (Pythagoras), the horizontal component of the straight
    line path (horizontal), the vertical component of the straight line path
    (vertical), or the total surface flow path (surface). Default is
    <strong>Horizontal</strong>.</dd>
  <dt>Check for Edge Contamination <div class='type'>Boolean</div></dt>
    <dd>A flag that determines whether the tool should check for edge
    contamination. This is defined as the possibility that a value may be
    underestimated due to grid cells outside of the domain not being counted.
    In the context of Distance Down this occurs when part of a flow path
    traced downslope from a grid cell leaves the domain without reaching
    a stream grid cell. With edge contamination checking selected, the
    algorithm recognizes this and reports no data for the result. This is
    the desired effect and indicates that values for these grid cells is
    unknown due to it being dependent on terrain outside of the domain of
    data available. Edge contamination checking may be overridden in cases
    where you know this is not an issue or want to evaluate the distance
    using only the fraction of flow paths that terminate at a stream.
    Default <strong>True</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>D-Infinity Drop to Stream Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>Creates a grid containing the distance to stream calculated using
    the D-infinity flow model and the statistical and path methods chosen.</dd>
