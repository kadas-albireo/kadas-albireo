<h1 class='module'>Pit Remove</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>Identifies all pits in the DEM and raises their
elevation to the level of the lowest pour point around their edge. Pits
are low elevation areas in digital elevation models (DEMs) that are
completely surrounded by higher terrain. They are generally taken to be
artifacts that interfere with the routing of flow across DEMs, so are
removed by raising their elevation to the point where they drain off the
edge of the domain. The pour point is the lowest point on the boundary of
the &quot;watershed&quot; draining to the pit. This step is not essential
if you have reason to believe that the pits in your DEM are real. If a
few pits actually exist and so should not be removed, while at the same
time others are believed to be artifacts that need to be removed, the
actual pits should have &quot;no data&quot; elevation values inserted at
their lowest point. &quot;No data&quot; values serve to define edges in
the domain, and elevations are only raised to where flow is off an edge,
so an internal &quot;no data&quot; value will stop a pit from being removed,
if necessary.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>Elevation Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A digital elevation model (DEM) grid to serve as the base input
    for the terrain analysis and stream delineation.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Pit Removed Elevation Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of elevation values with pits removed so that flow is routed
    off of the domain.</dd>
</dl>
