<h1 class='module'>Grid Network</h1>
<div class='author'>(c) 2010 by David G. Tarboton</div>
<div class='description'>Creates 3 grids that contain for each grid cell:
1) the longest path, 2) the total path, and 3) the Strahler order number.
These values are derived from the network defined by the D8 flow model.</div>
<div class='description'>The longest upslope length is the length of the
flow path from the furthest cell that drains to each cell. The total upslope
path length is the length of the entire grid network upslope of each grid
cell. Lengths are measured between cell centers taking into account cell
size and whether the direction is adjacent or diagonal.</div>
<div class='description'>Strahler order is defined as follows: A network
of flow paths is defined by the D8 Flow Direction grid. Source flow paths
have a Strahler order number of one. When two flow paths of different order
join the order of the downstream flow path is the order of the highest
incoming flow path. When two flow paths of equal order join the downstream
flow path order is increased by 1. When more than two flow paths join the
downstream flow path order is calculated as the maximum of the highest
incoming flow path order or the second highest incoming flow path order + 1.
This generalizes the common definition to cases where more than two flow
paths join at a point.</div>
<div class='description'>Where the optional mask grid and threshold value
are input, the function is evaluated only considering grid cells that lie
in the domain with mask grid value greater than or equal to the threshold
value. Source (first order) grid cells are taken as those that do not have
any other grid cells from inside the domain draining in to them, and only
when two of these flow paths join is order propagated according to the
ordering rules. Lengths are also only evaluated counting paths within the
domain greater than or equal to the threshold.</div>
<div class='description'>If the optional outlet point shapefile is used,
only the outlet cells and the cells upslope (by the D8 flow model) of them
are in the domain to be evaluated.</div>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Number of Processes <div class='type'>Integer</div></dt>
    <dd>The number of stripes that the domain will be divided into and the
    number of MPI parallel processes that will be spawned to evaluate each
    of the stripes.</dd>
  <dt>D8 Flow Direction Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid of D8 flow directions which are defined, for each cell, as
    the direction of the one of its eight adjacent or diagonal neighbors
    with the steepest downward slope. This grid can be obtained as the
    output of the &quot;D8 Flow Directions&quot; tool.</dd>
  <dt>Outlets Shapefile <div class='type'>Point Shapefile (optional)</div></dt>
    <dd>A point shapefile defining the outlets of interest. If this input
    file is used, only the cells upslope of these outlet cells are considered
    to be within the domain being evaluated.</dd>
  <dt>Mask Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid (optional)</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid that is used to determine the domain do be analyzed. If the
    mask grid value >= mask threshold (see below), then the cell will be
    included in the domain. While this tool does not have an edge contamination
    flag, if edge contamination analysis is needed, then a mask grid from
    a function like AreaD8 that does support edge contamination can be used
    to achieve the same result.</dd>
  <dt>Mask Threshold Value <div class='type'>Double (optional)</div></dt>
    <dd>This input parameter is used in the calculation mask grid value
    >= mask threshold to determine if the grid cell is in the domain to
    be analyzed. Default value is <strong>100</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<dl class='parameters'>
  <dt>Strahler Network Order Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid giving the Strahler order number for each cell. A network
    of flow paths is defined by the D8 Flow Direction grid. Source flow
    paths have a Strahler order number of one. When two flow paths of
    different order join the order of the downstream flow path is the
    order of the highest incoming flow path. When two flow paths of equal
    order join the downstream flow path order is increased by 1. When more
    than two flow paths join the downstream flow path order is calculated
    as the maximum of the highest incoming flow path order or the second
    highest incoming flow path order + 1. This generalizes the common
    definition to cases where more than two flow paths join at a point.</dd>
  <dt>Longest Upslope Length Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>A grid that gives the length of the longest upslope D8 flow path
    terminating at each grid cell. Lengths are measured between cell centers
    taking into account cell size and whether the direction is adjacent
    or diagonal.</dd>
  <dt>Total Upslope Length Grid <div class='type'>Raster Grid</div></dt>
    <dd>The total upslope path length is the length of the entire D8 flow
    grid network upslope of each grid cell. Lengths are measured between
    cell centers taking into account cell size and whether the direction
    is adjacent or diagonal.</dd>
