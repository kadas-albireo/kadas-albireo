<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <em>Toolbox</em> is the main element of the SEXTANTE GUI, and the one that
you are more likely to use in your daily work. It shows the list of all
available algorithms grouped in different blocks, and is the access
point to run them whether as a single process or as a batch process
involving several executions of a same algorithm on different sets of
inputs.</p>
<img alt="_images/toolbox.png" class="align-center" src="_images/toolbox.png" />
<p>The toolbox contains all the algorithms available, divided into groups.
Each group represents a so-called algorithm provider, which is a set of
algorithms coming from the same source, for instance, from a third-party
application with geoprocessing capabilities. Some of this groups
represent algorithms from one of such third-party applications
(like SAGA, GRASS or R), while other contain algorithms directly coded
along with SEXTANTE elements, not relying on any additional software.
Currently, these providers all reuse code from already-existing QGIS
plugins (more specifically, from the <em>fTools</em> vector library shiped along
with QGIS and the contributed mmqgis plugin that you can install using
the plugin manager), making them more useful, since they can be executed
from elements such as the modeler or the batch processing interface,
which we will soon describe.</p>
<p>Additionally, two more providers can be found, namely Models and
<em>Scripts</em>. This providers include user-created algorithms, and allow you
to define your own workflows and processing tasks. We will devote a full
section to them a bit later.</p>
<p>In the upper part of the toolbox you can find a text box. To reduce the
number of algorithms shown in the toolbox and make it easier to find the
one you need, you can enter any word or phrase on the text box. Notice
that, as you type, the number of algorithms in the toolbox is reduced to
just those which contain the text you have entered in their names.</p>
<p>To execute an algorithm, just double-click on its name in the toolbox.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-algorithm-dialog">
<h2>The algorithm dialog<a class="headerlink" href="#the-algorithm-dialog" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you double-click on the name of the algorithm that you want to
execute, a dialog similar to the next one is shown (in this case, the
dialog corresponds to the <em>SAGA-Convergence index</em> algorithm).</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="image" src="_images/parameters_dialog.png" />
</div>
<p>This dialog is used to set the input values that the algorithm needs to
be executed. It shows a table where input values and configuration
parameters are to be set. It, of course, has a different content
depending on the requirements of the algorithm to be executed, and is
created automatically based on those requirements. On the left side, the
name of the parameter is shown. On the right side the value of the
parameter can be set.</p>
<p>Although the number and type of parameters depend on the characteristics
of the algorithm, the structure is similar for all of them. The
parameters found on the table can be of one of the following types.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A raster layer, to select from a list of all the ones available
(currently opened) in QGIS. The selector contains as well a button on its right-hand side, to let you select filenames that represent layers currently not loaded in QGIS.</li>
<li>A vector layer, to select from a list of all the ones available in
the QGIS. Layers not loaded in QGIS can be selected as well, as in the case of raster layers, but only if the algorithm does not require a table field selected from the attributes table of the layer. In that case, only opened layers can be selected, since they need to be open so as to retrieve the list of field names available.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div>You will see a button by each vector layer selector. If the algorithm contains several of them, you will be able to toggle just one of them. If the button corresponding to a vector input is toggled, the algorithm will be executed iteratively on each one of its features. We will see more about this kind of execution at the end of this section.</div></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">A table, to select from a list of all the ones available in QGIS.
Non-spatial tables are loaded into QGIS like vector layers, and in
fact they are treated as such by the program. Currently, the list of
available tables that you will see when executing a SEXTANTE
algorithm that needs one of them is restricted to tables coming from
files in DBase (.dbf) or Comma-Separated Values (.csv) formats</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">An option, to choose from a selection list of possible options.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A numerical value, to be introduced in a text box. You will find a
button by its side. Clicking on it you will see a dialog that allows
you to enter a mathematical expression, so you can use it as a handy
calculator. Some useful variables related to data loaded into QGIS
can be added to your expression, so you can select a value derived
from any of this variables such as the cellsize of a layer or the
northern most coordinate of another one.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="image" src="_images/number_selector.png" />
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A range, with min and max values to be introduced in two text boxes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A text string, to be introduced in a text box.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A field, to choose from the attributes table of a vector layer or a
single table selected in another parameter.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A Coordinate Reference System. You can type the EPSG code directly in the text box, or select it from the CRS selection dialog that appear when you click on the button on the right-hand size</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A extent, to be entered by four number representing its xmin, max, ymin, ymax limits. Clicking on the button on the right-hand side of the value selector, a pop-up menu will appear, giving you two option: to select the value from a layer or the current canvas extent, or to define it by dragging directly onto the map canvas.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="_images/extent.png" src="_images/extent.png" />
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If you select the first option, you will see a window like the next one.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="_images/extent_list.png" src="_images/extent_list.png" />
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If you select the second one, the parameters window will hide itself, so you can click and drag onto the canvas. Once you have defined the selected rectangle, the dialog will reappear, containing the values in the extent text box.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="image" src="_images/extent_drag.png" />
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">A list of elements (whether raster layers, vector ones or tables), to
select from the list of the ones available in QGIS. To make the
selection, click on the small button on the left side of the
corresponding row to see a dialog like the following one.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="image" src="_images/multiple_selection.png" />
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A small table to be edited by the user. These are used to define
parameters like lookup tables or convolution kernels, among others.</p>
<p>Click on the button on the right side to see the table and edit its
values.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="image" src="_images/fixed_table.png" />
</div>
<p>Depending on the algorithm, the number of rows can be modified or
not, using the buttons on the right side of the window.</p>
<p>You will find a help button in the lower part of the parameters
dialog. If a help file is available, it will be shown, giving you
more information about the algorithms and detailed descriptions of
what each parameter does. Unfortunately, most algorithms lack good
documentation, but if you feel like contributing to the project, this
would be a good place to start...</p>

</ul>
<div class="section" id="a-note-on-projections">
<h3>A note on projections<a class="headerlink" href="#a-note-on-projections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>SEXTANTE -and also most of the external applications whose algorithms
are available from SEXTANTE- does not perform any reprojection on input
layers and assumes that all of them are already in a common coordinate
system and ready to be analized. Whenever you use more than one layer as
input to an algorithm, whether vector or raster, it is up to you to make
sure that they are all in the same coordinate system.</p>
<p>Note that, due to QGIS&#8217;s on-the-fly reprojecting capabilities, although
two layers might seem to overlap and match, that might not be true if
their original coordinates are used without reprojecting them onto a
common coordinate system. That reprojection should be done manually and
then use the resulting files as input to SEXTANTE. Also note that the
reprojection process can be performed with SEXTANTE, which incorporates
tools to do so.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-objects-generated-by-sextante-algorithms">
<h2>Data objects generated by SEXTANTE algorithms<a class="headerlink" href="#data-objects-generated-by-sextante-algorithms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Data objects generated by SEXTANTE can be of any of the following types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A raster layer</li>
<li>A vector layer</li>
<li>A table</li>
<li>An HTML file (used for text and graphical outputs)</li>
</ul>
<p>They are all saved to disk (there are no in-memory results), and the
parameters table will contain a text box corresponding to each one of
these outputs, where you can type the output channel to use for saving
it. An output channel contains the information needed to save the
resulting object somewhere. In the most usual case, you will save it to
a file, but the architecture of SEXTANTE allows for any other way of
storing it. For instance, a vector layer can be stored in a database or
even uploaded to a remote server using a WFS-T service. Although
solutions like these are not yet implemented, SEXTANTE is prepared to
handle them, and we expect to add new kinds of output channels in a near
feature.</p>
<p>To select an output channel, just click on the button on the right side
of the text box. That will open a save-file dialog, where you can select
the desired filepath. Supported file extensions are shown in the file
format selector of the dialog, depending on the kind of output and the
algorithm.</p>
<p>The format of the output is defined by the filename extension. The
supported formats depend on the ones supported by the algorithm itself.
To select a format, just select the corresponding file extension (or add
it if you are directly typing the filepath instead). If the extension of
the filepath you entered does not match any of the supported ones, a
default extension (usually <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dbf</span></tt> for tables, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tif</span></tt> for raster layers
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">shp</span></tt> for vector ones) will be appended to the filepath and the
file format corresponding to that extension will be used to save the
layer or table.</p>
<p>If you do not enter any filename, the result will be saved as a
temporary file and in the corresponding default file format, and will be
deleted once you exit QGIS (take care with that in case you save your
project and it contains temporary layers)</p>
<p>You can set a default folder for output data objects. Go to the
configuration dialog (you can open it from the SEXTANTE menu), and in
the <em>General</em> group you will find a parameter named <em>Output folder</em>.
This output folder is used as the default path in case you type just a
filename with no path (i.e. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myfile.shp</span></tt>) when executing an algorithm.</p>
<p>Apart from raster layers and tables, SEXTANTE also generates graphics
and texts as HTML files. These results are shown at the end of the
algorithm execution in a new dialog. This dialog will keep the results
produced by SEXTANTE during the current session, and can be shown at any
time by selecting the <em>SEXTANTE results viewer</em> menu</p>
<p>Some external applications might have files (with no particular extension restrictions) as output, but they do not belong to any of the categories above. Those outut files will not be processed by QGIS (opened or included into the current QGIS project), since most of the times correspond to file formats or elements not supported by QGIS. This is, for instance, the case with LAS files used for LiDAR data. The files get created, but you won&#8217;t see anything new in your QGIS working session.</p>
<p>For all the other types of outputs, you will find a check box that you can use to tell SEXTANTE not whether to load the file once it is generated by the algorithm or not. By default, all files are opened.</p>
<p>SEXTANTE does not support optional outputs, so all outputs are created, but you can uncheck the corresponding check box if you are not interested in a given output, which virtually makes it behave like an optional output (although the layer is created anyway, but if you leave the text box empty, it will be saved to a temporary file and deleted once you exit QGIS)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuring-sextante">
<h2>Configuring SEXTANTE<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-sextante" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As it has been mentioned, the configuration menu gives access to a new
dialog where you can configure how SEXTANTE works. Configuration
parameters are structured in separate blocks that you can select on the
left-hand side of the dialog.</p>
<p>Along with the aforementioned <em>Output folder</em> entry, the <em>General</em> block
contains parameters for setting the default rendering style for SEXTANTE
layers (that is, layers generated by using algorithms from any of the
SEXTANTE components). Just create the style you want using QGIS, save it
to a file, and then enter the path to that file in the settings so
SEXTANTE can use it. Whenever a layer is loaded by SEXTANTE and added to
the QGIS canvas, it will be rendered with that style.</p>
<p>Rendering stlyes can be configured individually for each algorithm and
each one of its outputs. Just right-click on the name of the algorithm
in the toolbox and select <em>Edit rendering styles</em>. You will see a dialog
like the one shown next.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="image" src="_images/rendering_styles.png" />
</div>
<p>Select the style file (*.qml) that you want for each output and press
OK.</p>
<p>Apart from the <em>General</em> block in the settings dialog, you will also
find one for each algorithm provider. They contain an <em>Activate</em> item
that you can use to make algorithms appear or not in the toolbox. Also,
some algorithm providers have their own configuration items, that we
will explain later when covering particular algorithm providers.</p>
