You can contribute at translate this help by creating an file *.properties named like
*.ts files (only the locale suffix) which found in Quantum-GIS\i18n directory. 
For example: for Italian translation copy and paste a *.properties file and rename it to "it.properties".
The only thing what you have to do is translate the values of the keys in dictionary.

i18n_dict = {
"key" : "value"
}
