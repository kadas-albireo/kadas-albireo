/**
 * Abstract base class for map rendering implementations.
 *
 * The API is designed in a way that rendering is done asynchronously, therefore
 * the caller is not blocked while the rendering is in progress. Non-blocking
 * operation is quite important because the rendering can take considerable
 * amount of time.
 *
 * Common use case:
 * 0. prepare QgsMapSettings with rendering configuration (extent, layer, map size, ...)
 * 1. create QgsMapRendererJob subclass with QgsMapSettings instance
 * 2. connect to job's finished() signal
 * 3. call start(). Map rendering will start in background, the function immediately returns
 * 4. at some point, slot connected to finished() signal is called, map rendering is done
 *
 * It is possible to cancel the rendering job while it is active by calling cancel() function.
 *
 * The following subclasses are available:
 * - QgsMapRendererSequentialJob - renders map in one background thread to an image
 * - QgsMapRendererParallelJob - renders map in multiple background threads to an image
 * - QgsMapRendererCustomPainterJob - renders map with given QPainter in one background thread
 *
 * @note added in 2.4
