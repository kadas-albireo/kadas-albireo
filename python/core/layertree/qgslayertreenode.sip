/**
 * This class is a base class for nodes in a layer tree.
 * Layer tree is a hierarchical structure consisting of group and layer nodes:
 * - group nodes are containers and may contain children (layer and group nodes)
 * - layer nodes point to map layers, they do not contain further children
 *
 * Layer trees may be used for organization of layers, typically a layer tree
 * is exposed to the user using QgsLayerTreeView widget which shows the tree
 * and allows manipulation with the tree.
 *
 * Ownership of nodes: every node is owned by its parent. Therefore once node
 * is added to a layer tree, it is the responsibility of the parent to delete it
 * when the node is not needed anymore. Deletion of root node of a tree will
 * delete all nodes of the tree.
 *
 * Signals: signals are propagated from children to parent. That means it is
 * sufficient to connect to root node in order to get signals about updates
 * in the whole layer tree. When adding or removing a node that contains further
 * children (i.e. a whole subtree), the addition/removal signals are emitted
 * only for the root node of the subtree that is being added or removed.
 *
 * Custom properties: Every node may have some custom properties assigned to it.
 * This mechanism allows third parties store additional data with the nodes.
 * The properties are used within QGIS code (whether to show layer in overview,
 * whether the node is embedded from another project etc), but may be also
 * used by third party plugins. Custom properties are stored also in the project
 * file. The storage is not efficient for large amount of data.
 *
 * Custom properties that have already been used within QGIS:
 * - "loading" - whether the project is being currently loaded (root node only)
 * - "overview" - whether to show a layer in overview
 * - "showFeatureCount" - whether to show feature counts in layer tree (vector only)
 * - "embedded" - whether the node comes from an external project
 * - "embedded_project" - path to the external project (embedded root node only)
 * - "legend/..." - properties for legend appearance customization
 * - "expandedLegendNodes" - list of layer's legend nodes' rules in expanded state
 *
 * @see also QgsLayerTree, QgsLayerTreeLayer, QgsLayerTreeGroup
 * @note added in 2.4
