<h3>Measure Tools</h3>
There are two measure tools: length and area. Currently the tools provide results in metric units only.
<h4>Measuring Lengths</h4>
To measure lengths, select the tool and click along the path you want to measure. The length of each segment is displayed as is the total length for the path.  With the measure tool, you can measure both distances and areas on the map canvas.
<h4>Measuring Areas</h4>
To measure areas, select the tool and click to create the area. The total area is dynamically displayed as you click.
