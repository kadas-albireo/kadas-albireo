<h3>Measure Tools</h3>
There are two measure tools: length and area. With them, you can measure both distances and areas on the map canvas. Currently the tools provide results in metric units only. A single right mouse click stops the measuring, while two right mouse clicks starts measuring anew.
<h4>Measuring Lengths</h4>
To measure lengths, select the tool and click along the path you want to measure. The length of each segment is displayed as is the total length for the path.
<h4>Measuring Areas</h4>
To measure areas, select the tool and click to create the area. The total area is dynamically displayed as you click.
