<h3>Create a New Oracle Connection</h3>
This dialog allows you to define the settings for a connection to a Oracle database.
<p>
<ul>
<li> <label>Name</label> A name to identify the connection settings.

<li> <label>Database</label> SID or SERVICE_NAME of the Oracle instance.

<li> <label>Host</label> Name or IP address of the computer hosting the database server

<li> <label>Port</label> IP port used by the database server

<li> <label>Username</label> Database user name.
<li> <label>Password</label> Database password.

<li> <label>Save Username</label> Indicates whether to save the database user name in the connection configuration.

<li> <label>Save Password</label> Indicates whether to save the database password in the connection settings.  <font color="red">Passwords are saved in <strong>clear text</strong> in the system configuration and in the project files!</font>

<li> <label>Only look in meta data table</label> Restricts the displayed tables to those that are in the all_sdo_geom_metadata view. This can speed up the initial display of spatial tables.

<li> <label>Only look for user's tables</label> When searching for spatial tables restrict the search to tables that are owner by the user.

<li> <label>Also list tables with no geometry</label>  Indicates that tables without geometry should also be listed by default.

<li> <label>Use estimated table statistics for the layer metadata</label> When
the layer is setup various metadata is required for the Oracle table. This
includes information such as the table row count, geometry type and spatial
extents of the data in the geometry column. If the table contains a large
number of rows determining this metadata is time consuming. By activating this
option the following fast table metadata operations are done: Row count is
determined from all_tables.num_rows. Table extents are always determined with
the SDO_TUNE.EXTENTS_OF function even if a layer filter is applied. The table
geometry is determined from the first 100 non-null geometry rows in the table.

<li> <label>Only existing geometry types</label> Only list the existing
geometry types and don't offer to add others.

</ul>
