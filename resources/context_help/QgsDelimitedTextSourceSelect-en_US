<h4><a name="re">Overview</a></h4>
<p>A &quot;delimited text file&quot; contains data in which each record starts on a new line, and 
is split into fields by a delimiter such as a comma.  
This type of file is commonly exported from spreadsheets (for example CSV files) or databases.  
Typically the first line of a delimited text file contains the names of the fields.  
</p>
<p>
Delimited text files can be loaded into QGIS as a layer. 
The records can be displayed spatially either as a point
defined by X and Y coordinates, or using a Well Known Text (WKT) definition of a geometry which may
describe points, lines, and polygons of arbitrary complexity.  The file can also be loaded as an attribute
only table, which can then be joined to other tables in QGis.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the geometry definition the file can contain text, integer, and real number fields.  QGis
will choose the type of field based on its contents. 
</p>
<h4><a name="creating">Creating a delimited text layer</a></h4>
<p>Creating a delimited text layer involves choosing the data file, defining the format (how each record is to
be split into fields), and defining the geometry is represented.  
This is managed with the delimited text dialog as detailed below.  
The dialog box displays a sample from the beginning of the file which shows how the format
options have been applied.
</p>
<h5>Choosing the data file</h5>
<p>Use the &quot;Browse...&quot; button to select the data file.  Once the file is selected the
layer name will automatically be populated based on the file name.  The layer name is used to represent
the data in the QGis legend.  
</p>
<p>
By default files are assumed to be encoded as UTF-8.  However other file
encodings can be selected.  For example &quot;System&quot; uses the default encoding for the operating system.  
It is safer to use an explicit coding if the QGis project needs to be portable.
</p>
<h5>Specifying the file format</h5>
<p>The file format can be one of
<ul>
    <li>CSV file format.  This is a format commonly used by spreadsheets, in which fields are delimited
    by a comma character, and quoted using a &quot;(quote) character.  Within quoted fields, a quote
    mark is entered as &quot;&quot;.</li>
    <li>Selected delimiters.  Each record is split into fields using one or more  delimiter character.
    Quote characters are used for fields which may contain delimiters.  Escape characters may be used 
    to treat the following character as a normal character (ie to include delimiter, quote, and 
    new line characters in text fields).  The use of delimiter, quote, and escape characters is detailed <a href="#csv">below</a>.
    <li>Regular expression.  Each line is split into fields using a &quot;regular expression&quot; delimiter.
    The use of regular expressions is details <a href="#regexp">below</a>.
</ul>
<h5>Record and field options</h5>
<p>The following options affect the selection of records and fields from the data file</p>
<ul>
    <li>Number of header lines to discard: used to ignore header lines at the beginning of the text file</li>
    <li>First record has fields names: if selected then the first record in the file (after the discarded lines) is interpreted as names of fields, rather than as a data record.</li>
    <li>Trim fields: if selected then leading and trailing whitespace characters will be removed from each field (except quoted fields). </li>
    <li>Discard empty fields: if selected then empty fields (after trimming) will be discard.  This 
    affects the alignment of data into fields and is equivalent to treating consecutive delimiters as a 
    single delimiter.  Quoted fields are never discarded.</li>
    <li>Decimal point is comma: if selected then commas are used as the decimal point in real numbers.  For
    example &quot;-51,354&quot; is equivalent to -51.354.
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>Geometry definition</h5>
<p>The geometry is can be define as one of</p>
<ul>
    <li>Point coordinates: each feature is represented as a point defined by X and Y coordinates.</li>
    <li>Well known text (WKT) geometry: each feature is represented as a well known text string, for example
    &quot;POINT(1.525622 51.20836)&quot;.  See details of the <a href="#wkt">well known text</a> format.
    <li>No geometry (attribute only table): records will not be displayed on the map, but can be viewed
    in the attribute table and joined to other layers in QGis</li>
</ul>
<p>For point coordinates the following options apply:</p>
<ul>
    <li>X field: specifies the field containing the X coordinate</li>
    <li>Y field: specifies the field containing the Y coordinate</li>
    <li>DMS angles: if selected coordinates are represented as degrees/minutes/seconds
    or degrees/minutes.  QGis is quite permissive in its interpretation of degrees/minutes/seconds.
    A valid DMS coordinate will contain three numeric fields with an optional hemisphere prefix or suffix
    (N, E, or + are positive, S, W, or - are negative).  Additional non numeric characters are 
    generally discarded.  For example &quot;N41d54'01.54&quot;&quot; is a valid coordinate.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>For well known text geometry the following options apply:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Geometry field: the field containing the well known text definition.</li>
    <li>Geometry type: one of &quot;Detect&quot; (detect), &quot;Point&quot;, &quot;Line&quot;, or &quot;Polygon&quot;.
    QGis layers can only display one type of geometry feature (point, line, or polygon). This option selects
    which geometry type is displayed in text files containing multiple geometry types. Records containing
   other geometry types are discarded.   
    If &quot;Detect&quot; is selected then the type of the first geometry in the file will be used.
    &quot;Point&quot; includes POINT and MULTIPOINT WKT types, &quot;Line&quot; includes LINESTRING and
    MULTLINESTRING WKT types, and &quot;Polygon&quot; includes POLYGON and MULTIPOLYGON WKT types.
</ul>

<h4><a name="csv">How the delimiter, quote, and escape characters work</a></h4>
<p>Records are split into fields using three character sets: delimiter characters, quote characters, 
and escape characters.  Quote and escape characters cannot be the same as delimiter characters - they
will be ignored if they are. Escape characters can be the same as quote characters, but behave differently
if they are.</p>
<p>The delimiter characters are used to mark the end of each field.  If more than one delimiter character
is defined then any one of the characters can mark the end of a field.  The quote and escape characters 
can override the delimiter character, so that it is treated as a normal character.</p>
<p>Quote characters may be used to mark the beginning and end of quoted fields. Quoted fields can 
contain delimiters and may span multiple lines in the text file.  If a field is quoted then it must
start and end with the same quote character.  Quote characters cannot occur within a field unless they
are escaped.</p>
<p>Escape characters which are not quote characters force the following character to be treated normally 
(that is, to stop it being treated as a new line, delimiter, or quote character).  
</p>
<p>If a quote character is also an escape character, then it can be represented in a quoted field by 
entering it twice.  For example if ' is a quote character and an escape character, then the string 
'Smith''s&nbsp;Creek' will represent the value Smith's&nbsp;Creek.
</p>
<h4><a name="regexp">How regular expression delimiters work</a></h4>
<p>Regular expressions are mini-language used to represent character patterns.  There are many variations
of regular expression syntax - QGis uses the syntax provided by the <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qregexp.html">QRegExp</a> class of the <a href="http://qt.digia.com">Qt</a> framework.</p>
<p>In a regular expression delimited file each line is treated as a record.  Each match of the regular expression in the line is treated as the end of a field.  
If the regular expression contains grouped expressions (eg &quot;(cat|dog)&quot;)
 then these are extracted as fields. 
If this is not desired then use non-capturing groups eg &quot;(?:cat|dog)&quot;.
</p>
<p>The regular expression is treated differently if it is anchored to the start of the line (that is, the pattern starts with &quot;^&quot;.
In this case the regular expression is matched against each line.  If the line does not match it is discarded
as an invalid record.  Each capture group in the expression is treated as a field.  The regular expression
is invalid if it does not have capture groups.  As an example this can be used as a (somewhat 
unintuitive) means of loading data with fixed width fields.  For example the 
expression
<pre>
^(.{5})(.{10})(.{20})(.{20}).*
</pre>
<p>will extract four fields of widths 5, 10, 20, and 20 characters from each line.  
Lines less than 45 characters long will be discarded.
</p>

<h4><a name="wkt">How WKT text is interpreted</a></h4>
<p>
The delimited text layer recognizes the following 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text">well known text</a> types - 
POINT, MULTIPOINT, LINESTRING, MULTILINESTRING, POLYGON, and MULTIPOLYGON.  It will accept geometries with
a Z coordinate (eg &quot;POINT&nbsp;Z&quot;), a measure (&quot;POINT&nbsp;M&quot;), or both (&quot;POINT&nbsp;ZM&quot;).
</p>
<p>
It can also handle the PostGIS EWKT variation, in which the geometry is preceded by an spatial reference 
system id (eg &quot;SRID=4326;POINT(175.3&nbsp;41.2)&quot;), and a variant used by Informix in which the WKT is 
preceded by an integer spatial reference id (eg &quot;1 POINT(175.3&nbsp;41.2)&quot;).
In both cases the SRID is ignored.
</p>

<h4><a name="python">Using delimited text layers in Python</a></h4>
<p>Delimited text data sources can be creating from Python in a similar way to other vector layers.
The pattern is:
</p>
<pre>
from PyQt4.QtCore import QUrl, QString<br />
from qgis.core import QgsVectorLayer, QgsMapLayerRegistry<br />
<br />
# Define the data source<br />
filename="test.csv"<br />
uri=QUrl.fromLocalFile(filename)<br />
uri.addQueryItem("type","csv")<br />
uri.addQueryItem("delimiter","|")<br />
# ... other delimited text parameters<br />
layer=QgsVectorLayer(QString(uri.toEncoded()),"Test CSV layer","delimitedtext")<br />
# Add the layer to the map<br />
if layer.isValid():<br />
    QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer( layer )<br />
</pre>
<p>The configuration of the delimited text layer is defined by adding query items to the uri.
The following options can be added
</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>encoding=..</i> defines the file encoding.  The default is &quot;UTF-8&quot;</li>
    <li><i>type=(csv|regexp|whitespace)</i> defines the delimiter type.  Valid values are csv, 
       regexp, and whitespace (which is just a special case of regexp).  Default is csv.</li>
       <li><i>delimiter=...</i> defines the delimiters that will be used for csv formatted files, 
       or the regular expression for regexp formatted files.  Default is , for CSV files.  There is
       no default for regexp files.</li>
       <li><i>quote=..</i> (for csv files) defines the characters used to quote fields. Default is &quot;</li>
       <li><i>escape=..</i> (for csv files) defines the characters used to escape the special meaning of the next character. Default is &quot;</li>
       <li><i>skipLines=#</i> defines the number of lines to discard from the beginning of the file. Default is 0.</li>
       <li><i>useHeader=(yes|no)</i> defines whether the first data record contains the names of the data fields. Default is yes.</li>
       <li><i>trimFields=(yes|no)</i> defines whether leading and trailing whitespace is to be removed from unquoted fields. Default is no.</li>
       <li><i>maxFields=#</i> defines the maximum number of fields that will be loaded from the file.  
       Additional fields in each record will be discarded. Default is 0 - display all fields.
       (This option is not available from the delimited text layer dialog box).</li>
       <li><i>skipEmptyFields=(yes|no)</i> defines whether empty unquoted fields will be discarded if they are empty (applied after trimFields). Default is no.</li>
       <li><i>decimalPoint=.</i> specifies an alternative character that may be used as a decimal point in numeric fields.  Default is a point (full stop) character.</li>
       <li><i>wktField=fieldname</i> specifies the name or number (starting at 1) of the field containing a well known text geometry definition</li>
       <li><i>xField=fieldname</i> specifies the name or number (starting at 1) of the field the X coordinate (only applies if wktField is not defined)</li>
       <li><i>yField=fieldname</i> specifies the name or number (starting at 1) of the field the Y coordinate (only applies if wktField is not defined)</li>
       <li><i>geomType=(auto|point|line|polygon|none)</i> specifies type of geometry for wkt fields, or none to load the file as an attribute-only table.  Default is auto.</li>
       <li><i>crs=...</i> specifies the coordinate system to use for the vector layer, in a format accepted by QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.createFromString (for example &quot;EPSG:4167&quot;).  If this is not 
       specified then a dialog box may request this information from the user.</li>
       <li><i>quiet=(yes|no)</i> specifies whether errors encountered loading the layer are presented in a dialog box (they will be written to the QGis log in any case). Default is no.</li>
</ul>
