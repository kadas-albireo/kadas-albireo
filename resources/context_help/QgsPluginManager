By checking the 'Show experimental plugins' checkbox, all plugins will be shown
in the lists, even the ones that are considered 'experimental' by the author.

<table border=1 width='95%' align='center'><tr><td>
Note: Experimental plugins are generally unsuitable for production use. These plugins are in the early stages of development, and should be considered "incomplete" or "proof of concept" tools. The QGIS development team does not recommend installing these plugins unless you intend to use them for testing purposes.
