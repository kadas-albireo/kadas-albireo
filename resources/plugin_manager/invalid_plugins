<h3>Invalid plugins</h3>

<p>
Plugins in this list here are <b>broken or incompatible</b> with your version of QGIS.
</p>

<p>
Click on an individual plugin; if possible QGIS shows you more information.
</p>

<p>
The main reasons to have invalid plugins is either that this plugin is not build 
for this version of QGIS. Maybe you can download an other version from <a href="http://plugins.qgis.org">plugins.qgis.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
Another common reason is that a python plugin needs some external python libraries (dependencies).
You can install them yourself, depending on your operating system. After a correct 
install the plugin should work.
