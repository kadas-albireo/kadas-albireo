  <name>Gradients from GIMP Paint Studio</name>
  <full>
    GIMP Paint Studio is a collection of brushes, gradients and
    accompanying "tool presets" for the GIMP. The aim is to create a
    working environment for graphic designers and artists to begin to
    paint and feel comfortable with GIMP from their first encounter.
    These gradients here are taken from version 1.5 of the package.
