    Used with high numbers for min. and max. cell brightness, this set
    reflects the brilliant autumn colors of Vermont. Flaming reds
    below the mountain tops give way to gold at lower elevations and
    finally transition to the greens of foliage not yet touched by
    autumn (my, we do wax on eloquently). And yes, the base color set
    is taken from SHADEREL.AVP, an earlier offering from DDV which is
    now included with ArcView.
