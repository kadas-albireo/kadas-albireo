      For use:

      * Using for commercial works, prints:
      Yes. There is no need ask permission first, or after.
      My resources are free for personal or commercial arts works. Credit is 
      enough if possible, if there is a description. Note link to me not 
      necessary. But it is good, I can not see them otherwise, feel free 
      about it.

      * Using in only DA:
      I submit them only DA yes, but you may use out of DA.
    
      For distribute:
    
      * I like sharing. So okay distributing my resources with credit,
      for good, for free. But,
    
      * Do not distribute my resource files without original preview. 
      ('cause previews including credit. Credit is important point on 
      this situation.)
    
      * Do not remove my name on it (preview). I saw some Turkish and 
      Russian forum sites delete artists names though, and they puting 
      their own cursed crappy logos on the previews. It is not sharing. 
      It is ...
    
      * Do not create collection with new preview, claiming open or close 
      they're your own creations.
    
      * Do not Rip/Merge with other artists work. Example: All in one 
      gradients by Merger/Ripper Nickname) for download/sell
    
      * Thanks
