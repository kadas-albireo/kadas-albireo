  <name>Diverging color-maps by Kenneth Moreland</name>
  <full>
    The color map derived here is an all-around good performer: it
    works well for low and high frequency data, orders the data, is
    perceptually linear, behaves well for observers with
    color-deficient vision, and has reasonably low impact on the
    shading of three-dimensional surfaces.
