  <name>Elevation from old encylopedias</name>
  <full>
    Elevation schemes taken from scans of maps of North America in old
    encyclopedias; the Meyers Konversationslexikon (1885&ndash;1890) and
    Nordisk familjebok (1876&ndash;1957). The fading of ink, the browning of
    the paper and inaccuracies in the scanning process will mean that
    these schemes are much muddier than the (unknown) authors
    intended.
