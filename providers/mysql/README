This directory will contain the QGIS data provider for MySQL 5.0. The provider
will intially not support proper relationship calculations (eg.
intersects/contains) due to limitations in the MySQL implementation of the OGC
functions. This will impact the use of identify and select functions in QGIS
for a MySQL layer.
