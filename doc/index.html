<h2>Whats new in Version 1.1.0?</h2>
<p>
Please note that this is a release in our 'unstable' release series. As 
such it contains new features and extends the programmatic interface over 
QGIS 1.0.x. If stability and long term support is more important to you 
then cool new and untested features, we recommend that you use a copy 
of QGIS from our stable 1.0.x release series.
