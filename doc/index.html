<dl><dt><span class="subheader">Special Requirements
    <ul class="normal">
      <li><a href="http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/index">Qt 4.3.0</a> is required. 
    <li>The <a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">Expat XML Parser</a> is required for the GPS plugin. This vastly improves the speed and memory management when loading GPX files.
    <li>The raster georeferencer plugin requires the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientfic Library</a> (GSL).
    </ul>
    <span class="normal">
    GSL and Expat are optional and required only if you want to use the georeferencer or GPS plugins respectively. SQLite is always required.
