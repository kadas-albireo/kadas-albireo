<h2>Whats new in Version 0.7</h2> 
<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="50%">
  <ul class="small">
    <li>    On the fly projection support to automatically project layers from different coordinate systems
    <li>    Map Composer for creating map layouts
    <li>    Toolbox for running GRASS tools from QGIS. The toolbox can be easily customized to add additional tools
    <li>    Handling of spatially enabled tables and views in PostgreSQL has been greatly improved. QGIS can now load any table in the database that contains a geometry column
    <li>    PostgreSQL views containing a geometry column can be viewed in QGIS
    <li>    Raster graphing tool to produce a histogram for a raster layer
    <li>    Raster query using the identify tool allows you to get the pixel values from a raster by making it the active layer and clicking on the point of interest
    <li>    User preferences provides customizable settings for the digitizing line width, color, and selection color
    <li>    New symbols for use with point layers are available from the layer properties dialog
</ul>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
 <ul class="small">
    <li>    Spatial bookmarks allow you to create and manage bookmarks for an area on the map. Bookmarks are persistent and global; meaning they are available for all projects
    <li>    Measure tool allows you to measure distances on the map with both segment length and total length displayed as you click
    <li>    GPX loading times and memory consumption for large GPX (GPS) files has been drastically reduced
    <li>    Many enhancements to the digitizing tools have been made, including the ability to capture data straight into PostgreSQL/PostGIS, and improvements to the definition of attribute tables for newly created layers
    <li>    The Raster Georeferencer plugin can be used to generate a world file for a raster. The plugin allows you to define known control points in the raster coordinate system. Once enough control points are defined, the world file can be generated and the raster properly displayed in QGIS or other GIS applications
    <li>    Improvements to the Mapserver export tool
</ul>

<dl><dt><span class="subheader">New Requirements
    <ul class="normal">
      <li><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> version 3 is now required. Sqlite is used to manage the projections database and store persistent data such as spatial bookmarks.
    <li>The <a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">Expat XML Parser</a> is required for the GPS plugin. This vastly improves the speed and memory management when loading GPX files.
    <li>The raster georeferencer plugin requires the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientfic Library</a> (GSL).
    </ul>
    <span class="normal">
    GSL and Expat are optional and required only if you want to use the georeferencer or GPS plugins respectively. SQLite is always required.
  </span>
  </dl>
<dl><dt><span class="subheader">Known Issues in this Release
    <dd>
    General
    <ul class="normal">
    <li>Project files from previous versions of QGIS will likely not work. This is due to changes related to on the fly projection.
    <li>Some internationalization (translation) files are incomplete. Updates to these files will be made available at http://community.qgis.org at a later date.
  </ul>

    </dd>
    <dd>
    OS X Specific
    <ul class="normal">
      <li>On Tiger (OS X 10.4), button animation only works with Qt 3.3.5 snapshot. Previous versions of OS X are not affected.
      <li>Some dialogs have cosmetic issues with buttons
      <li>Due to a limitation in the Quicktime graphics engine, there is a limit on the number points allowed per feature. See the Readme that comes with the OS X dmg
    </ul>
    </dd>
    <dd>
    Windows
    <ul class="normal">
      <li>The Windows release does not include the GPS plugin. The plugin will be made available at a later date.
