In addition, as a special exception, the QGIS Development Team gives
permission to link the code of this program with the Qt library,
including but not limited to the following versions (both free and
commercial): Qt/Non-commerical Windows, Qt/Windows, Qt/X11, Qt/Mac, and
Qt/Embedded (or with modified versions of Qt that use the same license
as Qt), and distribute linked combinations including the two. You must
obey the GNU General Public License in all respects for all of the code
used other than Qt. If you modify this file, you may extend this
exception to your version of the file, but you are not obligated to do
so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from
your version.
