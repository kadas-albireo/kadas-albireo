= Whats new in Version 2.0.1 'Dufour'? =

This is a small bugfix release to address the missing copyright / credits for
our new splash screen and to update supporting documentation. The spanish 
translation was also updated.

= Whats new in Version 2.0.0 'Dufour'? =

This is a new major release. Building on the foundation of
QGIS 1.x.x releases, QGIS Dufour introduces many new features,
improvements and bug fixes. Here is a summary of some of the
key new features.

- We have updated out icon theme to use the 'GIS' theme which introduces
      an improved level of consistency and professionalism to the QGIS user
      interface.
- The new symbol layer overview uses a clear, tree-structured layout
      which allows for easy and fast access to all symbol layers.
- QGIS 2.0 now includes Oracle Spatial support.
- With the new data defined properties, it is possible to control symbol
      type, size, color, rotation, and many other properties through feature
      attributes.
- You can now place html elements onto your map.
- Having nicely aligned map items is critical to making nice printed
      maps. Auto snapping lines have been added to allow for easy composer
      object alignment by simply dragging an object close to another.
- Sometimes you need to align objects a curtain distance on the composer.
      With the new manual snapping lines you are able to add manual snap lines
      which allow for better align objects using a common alignment. Simply
      drag from the top or side ruler to add new guide line.
- Ever needed to generate a map series? Of course you have. The composer
      now includes built in map series generation using the atlas feature.
      Coverage layers can be points, lines, polygons, and the current feature
      attribute data is available in labels for on the fly value replacement.
- A single composer window can now contain more then one page.
- The composer label item in 1.8 was quite limited and only allowed a single
      token $CURRENT_DATE to be used. In 2.0 full expression support has been
      added too greater power and control of the final labels.
- The map frame now contains the ability to show the extents of another
      map and will update when moved. Using this with the atlas generation
      feature now core in the composer allows for some slick map generation.
      Overview frame style uses the same styling as a normal map polygon
      object so your creativity is never restricted.
- Layer blending makes it possible to combine layers in new and exciting
      ways. While in older versions, all you could do was to make the layer
      transparent, you can now choose between much more advanced options such as
      "multiply", "darken only", and many more. Blending can be used in the
      normal map view as well as in print composer.
- HTML support has been added map composer label item to give you even
      more control over your final maps. HTML labels support full css styles
      sheets, html, and even javascript if you are that way inclined.
- The labelling system has been totally overhauled - it now includes many
      new features such as drop shadows, 'highway shields', many more data bound
      options, and various performance enhancements. We are slowly doing away
      with the 'old labels' system, although you will still find that
      functionality available for this release, you should expect that it will
      disappear in a follow up release.
- The full power of normal label and rule expressions can now be used for
      label properties. Nearly every property can be defined with an expression
      or field value giving you more control over the label result. Expressions
      can refer to a field (e.g. set the font size to the value of the field
      'font') or can include more complex logic. Examples of bindable
      properties include: Font, Size, Style and Buffer size.
- With the expression engine being used more and more though out QGIS to
      allow for things like expression based labels and symbol, many more
      functions have been added to the expression builder and are all accessible
      though the expression builder. All functions include comprehensive help
      and usage guides for ease of use.
- If the expression engine doesn't have the function that you need. Not to
      worry. New functions can be added via a plugin using a simple Python API.
- The Python API has been revamped to allow for a more cleaner, more
      pythonic, programming experience. The QGIS 2.0 API uses SIP V2 which
      removes the messy toString(), toInt() logic that was needed when working
      with values. Types are now converted into native Python types making for a
      much nicer API. Attributes access is now done on the feature itself using
      a simple key lookup, no more index lookup and attribute maps.
      **Note:** Most plugins written for QGIS < 1.x will need to be
        ported to work correctly in QGIS 2.x. Please consult
        http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Python_plugin_API_changes_from_18_to_20
        for more details.
- The raster data provider system has been completely overhauled. One of
      the best new features stemming from this work is the ability to 'Layer ->
      Save As...' to save any raster layer as a new layer. In the process you
      can clip, resample, and reproject the layer to a new Coordinate Reference
      System. You can also save a raster layer as a rendered image so if you for
      example have single band raster that you have applied a color palette to,
      you can save the rendered layer out to a georeferenced RGB layer.
- There are many, many more new features  in QGIS 2.0 - we invite
      you to explore the software and discover them all!


= Whats new in Version 1.8.0 'Lisboa'? =

QGIS 1.7.x releases, Lisboa introduces many new features,
improvements and bug fixes. Here is a summary of some of the

Please note that this is a release in our 'cutting edge' release series. As
such it contains new features and extends the programmatic interface over QGIS
1.0.x and QGIS 1.5.0. We recommend that you use this version over previous releases. 

This release includes over 177 bug fixes and many new features and enhancements. 
Once again it is impossible to document everything here that has changed so we will 
just provide a bullet list of key new features here.


==General Improvements==

- Added gpsd support to live gps tracking.
- A new plugin has been included that allows for offline editing.
- Field calculator will now insert NULL feature value in case of calculation
error instead of stopping and reverting calculation for all features.
- Allow user specific PROJ.4 search paths and update srs.db to include grid reference.
- Added a native (C++) raster calculator implementation which can deal with large rasters efficiently.
- Improved interaction with extents widget in statusbar so that the text
contents of the widget can be copied and pasted.
- Many improvements and new operators to the vector attribute table field
calculator including field concatenation, row counter etc.

=Whats new in Version 1.5.0?=

Please note that this is a release in our 'cutting edge' release series. As
such it contains new features and extends the programmatic interface over QGIS
1.0.x and QGIS 1.4.0. If an unchanging user interface, programmatic API and
long term support is more important to you then cool new and untested features,
we recommend that you use a copy of QGIS from our Long Term Support (LTS)1.0.x
release series. In all other cases we recommend that you use this version.


This release includes over 350 bug fixes, over 40 new features.

=Whats new in Version 1.4.0 'Enceladus'?=


Please note that this is a release in our 'cutting edge' release series. As
such it contains new features and extends the programmatic interface over QGIS
1.0.x and QGIS 1.3.0. If an unchanging user interface, programmatic API and
long term support is more important to you then cool new and untested features,
we recommend that you use a copy of QGIS from our Long Term Support (LTS)1.0.x
release series. In all other cases we recommend that you use this version.


This release includes around 200 bug fixes, nearly 30 new features and has had
a lot of love and attention poured in to it to take our favourite desktop GIS
application another step on the road to GIS nirvana! So much has happened in
the 3 months since our last release that it is impossible to document
everything here. Instead we will just highlight a couple of important new
features for you.


Probably the biggest new feature is the addition of the new vector symbology
infrastructure. This is provided alongside the old implementation - you can
switch using a button in the vector layer properties dialog. It does't replace
the old symbology implementation completely yet because there are various isues
that need to be resolved and a large amount of testinhen it is considered
ready.


QGIS now has a field calculator, accessible via a button in the attribute
section of the vector properties, and from the attribute table user interface.
You can use feature length, feature area, string concatenation and type
conversions in the field calculator, as well as field values.


The map composer has had a lot of attention. A grid can now be added to
composer maps. Composer maps can now be rotated in the layout. The limitation
of a single map layout per project has been removed. A new composer manager
dialog has been added to manage the existing composer instances. The composer
widget property sheets have been completely overhauled to use less screen space 


Various parts of the user interface have been overhauled with the goal of
improving consistency and to improve support for netbooks and other smaller
screen devices. Loading and saving of shortcuts. Position can now be displayed
as Degrees, Minutes, Seconds in the status bar. The add, move and delete vertex
buttons are now removed and the node tool is moved from the advanced editing
toolbar to the standard editing toolbar. The identification tool has also
undergone numerous improvements.


A render caching capability has been added to QGIS. This speeds up common
operations such as layer re-ordering, changing symbology, WMS / WFS client,
hiding / showing layers and opens the door for future enhancements such as
threaded rendering and pre-compositing layer cache manipulation. Note that it
is disabled by default, and can be enabled in the options dialog.


User defined SVG search paths are now added to the options dialog.


When creating a new shapefile, you can now specify its CRS. Also the avoid
intersections option for polygons is now also possible with background layers.


For power users, you can now create customizable attribute forms using Qt
Designer dialog UIs.




=Whats new in Version 1.3.0 'Mimas'?=

This release includes over 30 bug fixes and several useful new features:


== OSM plugin &amp; provider updates ==

     between the first and last intersection of the reshape line will be replaced.
- Added snapping to current layer in measure dialog.
- Added ability to select the primary key for views.

- 

=Version 1.2.0 'Daphnis'=

Please note that this is a release in our 'cutting edge' release series. As 
such it contains new features and extends the programmatic interface over 
QGIS 1.0.x. If stability and long term support is more important to you 
then cool new and untested features, we recommend that you use a copy 
of QGIS from our stable 1.0.x release series.
This release includes over 140 bug fixes and enchancements 
over the QGIS 1.1.0 release. In addition we have added 
the following new features:

==Editing==

Editing functionality in QGIS has had a major update in this release. This
includes the addition of new vector editing tools:

- delete part of multipart feature
- delete hole from polygon
- simplify feature
- Added a new "node" tool (in advanced digitizing toolbar).
- New functionality for merging features
- Added undo/redo functionality for vector layer editing.
- Added option to show only markers of selected features in editing mode.
- Change layer's icon in legend to reflext that the layer is editable.
- 

In addition, there are undo/redo actions in Edit menu, in Advanced digitizing toolbar
and there is a new dock widget displaying undo stack of active layer.

About the node tool: It resembles a tool for editing paths by nodes that is
present in every vector editor. How does it work (in QGIS)? Click on a
feature, its nodes will be marked by small rectangles. Clicking and dragging a
node moves it. Double clicking a segment will add a new node. Pressing delete
key will remove active node. It's possible to select more active nodes at
once: by clicking and dragging a rectangle. It's possible to select a segment's
adjacent nodes by clicking on the segment. It's possible to add/remove active
nodes by using Ctrl when clicking a node or dragging a rectangle

We recommend that you turn off vertex markers in QGIS options when working with
this tool: the redraws are much faster and the map is not cluttered with
markers. 

== Keyboard shortcuts ==

New feature: configure shortcuts for actions within main window of qgis!
See menu Setting->Configure shortcuts

== Map Composer ==

It is now possible to lock/unlock composer item positions by right mouse click.
The width and height of the composer map will now remain fixed if user sets the
composer map extent to the map canvas extent. possibility to display
current date in composer label by typing (d 'June' yyyy) or similar.
It is now possible to keep the current layers in a composer map even if further
layers are added to the main map. Export to PDF in composer is now possible.

== Attribute tables ==

It is now possible to search the attribute table within selected records only.
General speedups have been made on the attribute table. Setting of field width
and precision when adding attributes is now possible. Handling of attribute
types in WFS provider has bee improved.

Attribute aliases for vector layers are now available. The aliases are shown
instead of the original field names in the info tool and attribute table to
make things easier for end users. There is now a GUI for setting edit widgets
for layer attributes.  A new dialog allows loading a value map from a layer
(could be non-spatial table too!).  The edit widgets settings will also now
be respected in the attribute table.

== Plugins ==

- The order of layers in the WMS dialog can now be changed.
- The eVis plugin, version 1.1.0, has been added to the QGIS project and
  included as a standard plugin. More information about eVis can be found here:
  http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/evis/documentation.php .
- The interpolation plugin now has the ability to use line layers as constrains
  for triangulation in interpolation plugin. You can also now save the
  triangulation to shape file.
- An new OpenStreetMap provider and plugin have been added to QGIS.
- 

== Projects Management ==

QGIS now includes support for  project relative position of file data sources
and svgs. The saving of relative paths of file data sources is optional.

== PostGIS & the PostgreSQL Provider ==

You can now select the SSL mode when adding a new DB connection. Turning off
SSL encryption can greatly improve performance of PostGIS data loading where
connection security is not required. Support has been added for more native
types and for setting of column comments.

== Symbology enhancements ==

- allow refresh of symbols via popup menu on the renderer's symbol selection
- add support for data defined symbols
- add support for font symbol markers (only data defined - no gui yet)
- add symbol size in map units (ie. symbols that keep the size in mapunits
  independent of the mapscale)
- 

== Command line arguments ==

Added command line argument support on windows.
Enhancement of command line arguments:
- allow given snapshot sizes
- allow suppression of splash screen
- capture map decorations from plugins on snapshots

== Grass ==

There is a new GRASS shell. Also there have been many cleanups and consistency
updates.

    in ogr provider
- 2004-12-05 [gsherman] 0.6.0rc2 Fixed bug 1079392 that caused QGIS to crash when a query was entered that
 resulted in the layer being created with no records. Additional validation
 of the SQL query was added to the query builder.  When Ok is clicked on
 the builder dialog, the query is sent to the database and the result
 checked to ensure that it will create a valid PostreSQL layer.  Added tr
 to a number of strings that weren't prepared for translation in the vector
 dialog properties code Created QgsDataSourceURI structure to hold all the
 pertinent information associated with a PostgreSQL layer connection,
 including host, database, table, geometry column, username, password,
 port, and sql where clause.
- 2004-12-03 [gsherman] 0.6.0rc1 Commented out excessive debug statements in the postgres provider
- 2004-12-03 [gsherman] 0.6.0rc1 Changing the SQL query for a PostgreSQL
 layer using the query builder from the vector layer properties dialog now
 properly updates the mapcanvas extents and feature count.
 Fix for crash in pg buffer plugin (bug 1077412). Crash is due to the
 addition of sql where clause support in the postgres provider. The provider
 was not checking to see if a sql key was included in the datasource uri and
 thus copying the entire URI as the where clause.
 The .shp extension is now added the new vector layer name (if not specified
 by the user).  The .qgs extension is now added to a project file when using
 save or save as (if not specified by the user). 


= 0.5 =

- 2004-12-01 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel30 Added functions to qgsdataprovider.h to support updating the feature count
 and extents. To be supported, these functions must be implemented in the data
 provider implementation. The default implementations don't do anything useful.
- QgsVectorLayer now has functions for requesting feature count, extent
 update, and the subset defintiion string (usually sql) from the underlying
 data provider. Providers do not need to implement these functions unless
 they want to support subsetting the layer via a layer definition query or
 other means.

2004-11-27 [larsl] 0.5.0devel30
Fixed feature addition in GPX layers, it now works again

2004-11-22 [mcoletti] 0.5.0devel29
QgsProject properties now re-designed to be similar to QSettings
  
2004-11-20 [timlinux] 0.5.0devel28
Added the capability to interrupt the rendering of the currently drawing map
layer by pressing the escape key. Repeat and rinse to interrupt drawing of all
vector layers. Not implemented for raster layers yet.

2004-11-11 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel27
First pass at a PostgreSQL query builder. This is not entirely
   functional yet. Fields for a table are displayed and sample or all
   values can be displayed. Double-clicking on a field name or sample
   value pastes it into the sql query box at the current cursor
   position. The test function is not implemented yet nor is the type
   checking to allow auto quoting of text values in the sql statement.

2004-11-19 [mcoletti] 0.5.devel26
Changed QgsProject properties interface to be more similar to
   QSettings.  New properties are emitted to file.  There is a known
   bug with QStringLists in that thre're redundant copies written to
   the file.  New properties aren't read yet.  Will be adding code
   for that over next couple days.

2004-11-17 [timlinux] 0.5.0devel25
Added a little checkbox to the bottom right of status bar that 
when checked will suppress rendering of layers in main canvas 
and overview canvas, This is useful if you want to load a bunch 
of layers and tweak their symbology etc without having delays 
caused by rerendering everything after each change you make.

2004-11-16 [larsl] 0.5.0devel24
Reimplemented nextFeature() so features are visible again

2004-11-13 [larsl] 0.5.0devel23
Changed QgsIdentifyResults and QgsVectorLayer to show all attributes
   automatically (expand the feature node) if only one feature is identified

2004-11-11 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel22
Added ifdef's for WIN32 around dynamic_casts in the vector renderer
  dialogs. Even though rtti is enabled, use of dynamic casts causes seg
  faults under WIN32.

2004-11-09 [timlinux] 0.5.0devel21
Added options to graticule builder to allow you to define origin and
enpoints and to set the graticule size at < 1 degree. Note that there is
little error checking in there still, so putting in dodgy numbers may cause
qgis to crash.

2004-11-04 [timlinux] 0.5.0devel20
Added scale dependent visibility support to both raster and vector layers.

2004-11-02 [larsl] 0.5.0devel19
Added menu item for creating an empty GPX file

Added defaultValue() in QgsVectorLayer and QgsVectorDataProvider,
   implemented it in the GPX provider

2004-10-29 [stevehalasz] 0.5.0devel15
* Write layers to projects files in the proper order by iterating over the
  zOrder in the map canvas. Fixes bug #1054332.

* Remove the <zorder> tag from the dtd. It is superfluous.

2004-10-26 [mcoletti] 0.5.0devel13
regarding saving and restoring units in project files.

Some changes in the GPS plugin:
   * Changed the tooltip of the action from "GPS Importer" to "GPS Tools"
   * Removed some old unused code
   * Made the upload/download tools much more flexible by letting users
     specifying "devices" with upload and download commands
   * Remember the last used device and port for uploads and downloads
   * Remember the last directory that a GPX file was loaded from

2004-10-20 [mcoletti] 0.5.0devel10
merged in qgsproject-branch
  
2004-10-19 [larsl] 0.5.0devel9

2004-10-18 [larsl] 0.5.0devel6
Removed duplicate code, added bounds calculation for digitized features in the GPX provider

2004-10-18 [larsl] 0.5.0devel5
Changes to the GPX provider:
   * Implemented isEditable(), isModified(), commitChanges(), and rollBack()
   * Removed the useless lat and lon attributes in waypoint features
   * Cleaned up the attribute parsing in addFeature()
   GPX editing should now work again.

2004-10-17 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel4
OGR provider now uses GEOS to select features when doing identify and
   select operations.

2004-10-16 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel3
Fixed OGR filters in the add layer dialog box using fix in qgsproject-branch
Reverted images in qgisappbase.ui to XPM so QGIS will compile on Qt < 3.x

2004-10-11 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel2
Added man page (qgis.man) that gets installed in man1 as qgis.1

2004-10-09 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel1
Changed name to Simon
Added Simon splash screen
Fixed command line loading bug to eliminate bogus warning for vector layers

   primary key is not of type int4 (bug 1042706).
Added Latvian translation file (untranslated at present)

2004-09-23 [larsl] 0.4.0devel38
Removed support for loading Geocaching.com LOC files

2004-09-20 [tim] 0.4.0devel37
Shameless acknowledge not keeping this file up to date!
Sort out clipping problems with labeller

2004-09-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel36
Added the element definition of uniquevaluemarker to qgis.dtd

2004-09-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel35
Re-fixed bug 987874, the provider will now skip geometry-less features
   but keep reading other features

2004-09-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel34
Fixed bug 987874 which caused QGIS to crash when showing the attribute
   table for shapefile layers with features with NULL geometry 
   (GetGeometryRef() returns NULL) - the OGR provider now treats features
   with NULL geometry as NULL features, i.e. EOF

2004-09-15 [larsl] 0.4.0devel33
Fixed QgsUValMaDialogBase so the listbox doesn't take up all of the space

2004-09-14 [larsl] 0.4.0devel32
Added the SVG icons in src/svg/gpsicons

2004-09-13 [larsl] 0.4.0devel31
Added the unique value marker renderer

2004-09-12 [larsl] 0.4.0devel30
Scale down SVG symbols
Display rasters without geotransform info as "1 pixel = 1 unit"

2004-09-12 [larsl] 0.4.0devel29
Fixed bug in scale_bar plugin that would cause QGIS to freeze when a
   layer with one point was loaded

2004-09-12 [larsl] 0.4.0devel28
The device lists in the GPS plugin should show /dev/ttyUSB* devices too
   now (for serial USB adapters) on Linux

2004-09-08 [larsl] 0.4.0devel27
Fixed bug that crashed QGIS when the user selected records in the attribute
   table for a layer that used the single marker renderer

2004-09-01 [mcoletti] 0.4.0devel26
Start of new qgs project file class.  Obviously work-in-progress.

Committed for back-up sanity and to elicit comments from the bored.

2004-09-01 [mcoletti] 0.4.0devel25
QgsRect : 

  - no longer waste copy of QgsPoint in ctor

2004-08-14 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel23
Moved plugin toolbar to the qgisappbase toolbar container rather than
  dynamically allocating it. This allows the state/docking position gets
  restored each time the app starts.

2004-08-26 [mcoletti] 0.4.0devel22
qgisapp.cpp:

 - fixed bug 1017079, where loading projects would cause app to crash

qgsprojectio.cpp:

 - minor code change; commented out superfluous code

2004-08-26 [mcoletti] 0.4.0devel21
Now explicitly check for command line arguments via $# instead of $@.  Using
$@ caused the script to crash when more than one command line argument was
passed in.  (E.g., specifying multiple files for CVS commits.)

2004-08-25 [mcoletti] 0.4.0devel20
Now explicitly use QgsMapLayerRegistry instance instead of data members.  (Of
which two both referred to the same instance.)

2004-08-25 [mcoletti] 0.4.0devel19
Deleted two data members that referred to the Singleton object
QgsMapLayerRegistry.  Now explicitly use QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance(),
which emphasizes that you're accessing a Singleton.

2004-08-22 [larsl] 0.4.0devel18
Fixed a bug that caused SVG markers to be huge when oversampling was turned on

2004-08-22 [larsl] 0.4.0devel17
Fixed transparency in SVG sumbols

2004-08-21 [larsl] 0.4.0devel16
Added a black frame around the white rectangle around SVG symbols to make it look cleaner, can be removed when transparency is fixed

2004-08-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel15
Added more attribute fields to the GPX provider: cmt, desc, src, sym, number, urlname

2004-08-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel14
Forgot to calculate bounds for user-added routes and tracks in the GPX
   provider, which caused unpredictable drawing bugs since selection wouldn't
   work. Fixed.

2004-08-14 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel13
Moved common toobar icons to drop-down tool menus. This includes the
   overview, hide/show all, and capture tools

2004-08-18 [jobi] 0.4.0devel12
added Italian translation thanx to Maurizio Napolitano
updated all translations

2004-08-17 [larsl] 0.4.0devel11
Implemented GPX file writing - GPX layers are now written back to file
   when features are added

2004-08-17 [larsl] 0.4.0devel10
* More digitizing support for the GPX provider. Routes and tracks can now be 
  created. Nothing is written to file yet.

2004-08-14 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel9
Added mouse wheel zoom. Moving wheel forward zooms in by a factor of 2.

2004-08-12 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel8
Rearranged capture icons and added them to the MapNavigation action group
   so that the icons remain depressed while the tool is active. (bugs
   994274 and 994272)
Fixed preferences bug (992458) that caused themes to disappear when setting
   options.
 
2004-07-19 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel7
Fixed broken setDisplayField function in qgsvectorlayer
Added display/label field handling. Field is now set when the layer is
   added by examining the fields and attempting to make a "smart" choice. The
   user can later change this field from the layer properties dialog. This field
   is used as the item name in the identify box (top of the tree for each feature
   and its attributes) and will eventually be used in labelling features.
Cleanup of postgres add layer dialog 
Removed excessive debug output from qgsfeature 

2004-07-18 [larsl] 0.4.0devel6
Changed Graduated Marker renderer to use the SVG cache

2004-07-17 [larsl] 0.4.0devel5
Added SVG cache and started using it in the Single Marker renderer

2004-07-10 [larsl] 0.4.0devel4
Added code to QgsProjectIo that saves and loads the provider key of a vector
   layer in the project file, so delimited text layers and GPX layers can be
   saved in a project. Haven't tested for grass vector layers, but it should
   work.

2004-07-09 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel3
First pass at defining PostgreSQL layers using a where clause in the
   data provider. UI may need some work. When adding a PG layer, double-
   click on the layer name to define the where clause. Do not include the
   where keyword
2004-07-05 [ts] 0.4.0devel2
Added option for forcing redraw when adding a raster - intended for use by
   plugins.

2004-07-05 [larsl] 0.4.0devel1
Moved lots of code from PluginGui to Plugin in the GPS plugin, use signals
   and slots for communication

2004-06-30 [jobi] 0.3.0devel58
made ready for release
added interface version for libqgis

2004-06-28 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel57

2004-06-26 [ts] 0.3.0devel52
Extents are now correctly restored when project is loaded

2004-06-24 [ts] 0.3.0devel51
Completion of projectio fixes to freeze canvas and restore zorder correctly. 
   Small issue with restoring extents properly needs to be resolved still.

2004-06-23 [mcoletti] 0.3.0devel50
Fixed bug whereby one couldn't downcast from QgsMapLayer* to a
QgsVectorLayer*.  Apparently this was because dlopen()'d files didn't have
full access to global variables.  Now plug-ins can use global variable by
linking with -rdynamic and using dlopen()'s RTLD_GLOBAL flag.

2004-06-21 [ts] 0.3.0devel49

Revised raster stats emiting of progress update to not do it when stats are 
   fetched from cache. QGisApp progress bar now updates as each layer is rendered 
   in the mapCanvas.
   
Some minor updates to projectio   

2004-06-21 [larsl] 0.3.0devel48
Hooked up the GPS gui to code that uses gpsbabel to import lots of GPS file
   formats to GPX

2004-06-21 [jobi] 0.3.0devel47
Added check for wrong UI version to make release
fixed wrong versions and DOS endlines

2004-06-21 [ts] 0.3.0devel46

Got tired of always resetting my gidbase dir everytime qgis restarts - 
   added it to qsettings.

2004-06-21 [ts] 0.3.0devel45

Complete buffering so that bar as well as text will be visible on both 
   light and dark surfaces.

2004-06-21 [ts] 0.3.0devel44

Fix for bug [ 973922 ] Overview shows layers in wrong order

Fixed show stopper bug where maplayerregistry wasnt being cleared properly on file new

Added setZOrder which will be used in next commit to fix projectio zorder problem

2004-06-20 [ts] 0.3.0devel43

Fix anoying 'mapcanvas isnt freezing while loading rasters' bug

2004-06-19 [ts] 0.3.0devel42

Add white buffer around scalebar text...buffer around lines to come...

2004-06-18 [larsl] 0.3.0devel41
Added an option for setting the length of the scale bar to closest
   integer < 10 times power of 10
   
2004-06-16 [ts] 0.3.0devel40

Win32 support for package path - which will hopefully ensure pyramid and overview mini 
   icons are displayed on legend entry now.

Beginnings of generic vector file writer - incomplete and doesnt do anything useful 
   yet except has abilty to make a shapefile with a couple of user defined fields e.g. 
   to create a new point shapefile:
    
   QgsVectorFileWriter myFileWriter("/tmp/test.shp", wkbPoint);
   if (myFileWriter.initialise())
   {
     myFileWriter.createField("TestInt",OFTInteger,8,0);
     myFileWriter.createField("TestRead",OFTReal,8,3);
     myFileWriter.createField("TestStr",OFTString,255,0);
     myFileWriter.writePoint(&theQgsPoint);
   }


2004-06-16 [larsl] 0.3.0devel40
Added skeleton code for importing other GPS file formats using GPSBabel

>>>>>>> 1.136
2004-06-16 [ts] 0.3.0devel39
Added small icon displayed on raster legend showing whether this layer is in overview 
   or not. This icon needs "petification!". Need to do the ame for vector once I figure 
   out where to put the code!'

2004-06-16 [ts] 0.3.0devel38
Added new menu / toolbar option to add all loaded layers into the overview.

2004-06-15 [larsl] 0.3.0devel37
More preparation for GPS upload code
New function in QgisInterface - getLayerRegistry()

2004-06-14 [ts] 0.3.0devel36
Added capability for plugins to clear the current project ignoring 
   the project dirty flag (ie force new project).

2004-06-14 [ts] 0.3.0devel35
Added addRasterLayer(QgsRasterLayer *) to the plugin interface. This allows plugins 
   to construct their own raster object, set its symbolisation and the pass it over 
   to the app to be loaded into the canvas.

2004-06-13 [ts] 0.3.0devel34
Removed gdal deps in qgisapp.

Moved raster load stuff to a group at the end of qgisapp.cpp file.

Removed generically usable raster fns from qgisapp to static methods of qgsrasterlayer.

Some renaming of variable names etc.

Added addRaster(QgsRasterLayer *) private method to qgisapp - which is intended for 
   use via plugins that want to load  'ready made' / symbolised raster layer into the mapCanvas.

2004-06-13 [ts] 0.3.0devel33

Globally changed legen item fonts to arial 10pt for consistency with rest of ui. Will soft
   code in qgsoptions in next release.

2004-06-13 [ts] 0.3.0devel32
Add version name to splash

2004-06-13 [ts] 0.3.0devel31
Implemented a new map cursor type : Capture Point (little pencil icon on your toolbar). 
   At the moment clicking on the map in capture point mode will cause QgsMapCanvas to emit 
   an xyClickCoordinate(QgsPoint) signal which is picked up by qgisapp and the coordinates
   are placed into the system clipboard. 

  In release 0.5 this will be extended to provide simple point vector file data capture / 
  digitising facility. This will be implemented by means of a plugin which will utilise the 
  aforementioned xyClickCoordinate(QgsPoint) signal.

2004-06-12 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel30
Windows support -- lots of changes

2004-06-11 [larsl] 0.3.0devel29
Let the user choose GPS protocol and feature type to download

2004-06-10 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel28
Added display of extent rectangle in the overview map. Current
   implementation is not optimized (requires repaint of the overview canvas to
   display updated rectangle)
Added acetate layer support to the map canvas. Currently there is only one
   acetate object type - QgsAcetateRectangle, which inherits from
   QgsAcetateObject. More acetate types will follow...

2004-06-10 [ts] 0.3.0devel27
Modified projectio (serialisation and deserialisation of project files) to
   use maplayerregistry and not mapcanvas.

Implemented state handling of 'showInOverview' property in project io.
2004-06-10 [petebr] 0.3.0devel26
Tidied up the SPIT gui to match the plugin template.
Fixed bug in scale bar which displayed the bar the wrong size!
Fixed all the plugins so they do not do multiple refreshes on exit.
Added color selection for scale bar.

2004-06-09 [mcoletti] 0.3.0devel25
Added support for a feature type name in QgsFeature.  The GDAL/OGR shape file
provider now also provides the feature type name.

2004-06-09 [petebr] 0.3.0devel24
Added the scale bar plugin. My first solo plugin! :-)

2004-06-09 [ts] 0.3.0devel23
Added "Show in overview" option to vector popup menu. 

Removed overview stuff from debug only version of qgisapp.

Did plumbing for enableing disabling layers in overview from popup context menu.

Whoopdeedooo. :-)

All that remains to do now is sort out syncronisation of layer ordering between main map canvas and overview canvas.

2004-06-09 [ts] 0.3.0devel22
Fixed bug that causes qgis to crash when an empty .dbf is encountered.
Added transparency slider to raster popup menu.

2004-06-09 [larsl] 0.3.0devel21
Hid the "GPS download file importer" tab

2004-06-08 [larsl] 0.3.0devel20
Call GPSBabel using QProcess instead of system(), show a progress bar while
   GPSBabel is running, show the messages printed to GPSBabel's stderr if
   something goes wrong

2004-06-08 [larsl] 0.3.0devel19
Started adding GPS data download capability. Only tracklogs from Garmin
   devices for now, routes and waypoints and Magellan support will come in
   the near future.

2004-06-08 [jobi] 0.3.0devel18
updated ts files
fixed German translation
added translation support to external help applications (grid_maker and gpsimporter)

2004-06-07 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel17
Added update threshold to user options. Update threshold defines the number
   features to read before updating the map display (canvas). If set to zero
   the display is not updated until all features have been read.
        
2004-06-07 [larsl] 0.3.0devel16
Changed some calls to QMessageBox::question() to QMessageBox::information()
   since Qt 3.1.2 doesn't have question()

2004-06-07 [ts] 0.3.0devel15
Implemented map overview using maplayers rather than snapshots of a raster layer.

Implemented QgsMapLayerRegistry  - s singleton object that keeps track of
   loaded layers. When a layer is added an entry is made in the registry. When a
   layer is removed, the registry emits a layerWillBeRemoved signal that is
   connected to any mapvcanvas, legend etc that may be using the layer. The
   objects using the layer can then remove any reference they make to the layer -
   after which the registry deletes the layer object.

This fixes a problem with adding an overview map which caused qgis to crash
   when a layer was removed because it was trying to delete the same pointer
   twice.

Added a better implementation of the overview map below map legend.

Refactoring in qgis app - all private members now adhere to qgis naming
   conventions (prefixed with m).


Import Note *ONLY THE MAPLAYER REGISTRY SHOULD DELETE QgsMapLayer::LayerType NOW *

2004-06-03 [ts] 0.3.0devel14
Added getPaletteAsPixmap function to raster and display on raster props
   dialog. Also added gdaldatatype to raster props metadata dialog.

2004-06-04 [jobi] 0.3.0devel13
fixed tims typo with GDAL_LDADD
cleaned pluginnames

2004-06-03 [jobi] 0.3.0devel12
fixed bug #965720 by adding math.h for gcc 3.4 problems

2004-06-02 [ts] 0.3.0devel11
Changed maplayer draw() and its subclasses vectorlayer and rasterlayer to
not need src parameter (this can be obtained from painter->device()).

More work on print system - still only works well on A4 landscape.

Northarrow and copyright label plugins now hidethemselves before emitting
  update signals when ok is pressed.

QGSMapCanvas can now return the (last calculated) scale using getScale

QGSMapCanvas Impl struct rename to CanvasProperties. QgsMapCanvas impl_
   member renamed to mCanvasProperties.

2004-05-31 [ts] 0.3.0devel10
Added basic print capability to qgis....consider this a work in progress.
2004-05-31 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel9
Changed QgsIdentifyResultsBase to inherit from QWidget instead of QDialog
  so window position can be saved/restored from user settings each time.
Changed qgis.h int version number to 300 (should have been done at release) 

2004-05-30 [ts] 0.3.0devel8
Fix poorly placed status text on splash screen.

2004-05-27 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel7

Altered buttons on GUI to a standardised layout - HELP - APPLY - OK - CANCEL

2004-05-26 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel5
Added theme selection to the user preferences dialog. Currently there
   is only one theme (default) available

2004-05-26 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel4
Added theme support for loading png icons during startup. This solves
   ugly icon problem when encoded as xpm in the ui files. See comments
   in the QgisApp::settheme() function for details

2004-05-26 [larsl] 0.3.0devel3
Added some calls to std::string::c_str() to hopefully make Qt without STL 
   happy

2004-05-26 [larsl] 0.3.0devel2


2004-05-26 [larsl] 0.3.0devel1
Fixed a bug that caused the legend checkboxes to always be unchecked when
   using Qt 3.1.2 by removing QgsLegendItem::setOn(), don't know how this
   affects newer Qt

2004-05-25 [larsl] 0.2.0devel37
Show the legend widgets in debug mode too

2004-05-25 [larsl] 0.2.0devel36
Fixed some more instances of the same bug in raster layer

2004-05-25 [ts] 0.2.0devel35
Disable overview widget for release. Minor bugfix in rasterlayer picker up by
Larsl which is only encountered bu i8n users. Miscellaneous other fixes
including proper rotation support for north arrows in all 4 corners of
display, inproved refresh behaviour of n-arrow and copyright plugin, better
state hadnling for copyright plugin.

2004-05-25 [larsl] 0.2.0devel34
Updated all ts files and translated new messages in the swedish file

Updated the swedish translation

2004-05-25 [larsl] 0.2.0devel32
Resaved plugins/copyright_label/pluginguibase.ui with designer 3.1 to fix
   const problem

>>>>>>> 1.120
2004-05-20 [ts] 0.2.0devel31
First working version for gui pyramid manager (implemented as tab in raster
props). Raster legend entry now stretched to width of legend and show an icon
indicating whether the layer has overviews or not. Added struct and qvaluelist
to raster to store pyramids state in.

2004-05-20 [gsherman] 0.2.0devel30
Changed release name to Madison in qgis.h
Added QgsScaleCalculator to libqgis spec in src/Makefile.am
Additional debug statements in grass data provider

2004-05-20 [ts] 0.2.0devel29
Added pyramid / no pyramid icon to raster legend entry and made legend 
pixmap fill up all available space in leend width. Added new dir for icons
in src that will be installed to PKGPATH/share/icons

2004-05-20 [ts] 0.2.0devel28
Changed splash to load picture from file instead of an xpm include. This
will hopefully speed up compile times for folks building on p133's. Changed
splash image to the fluffball ready for 0.3 release.

2004-05-19 [larsl] 0.2.0devel27
Implemented nextFeature(list<int>&) in the GPX provider

2004-05-18 [gsherman] 0.2.0devel26
Saved the qgsappbase.ui and the qgsprojectpropertiesbase.ui files (modified
at version 0.2.0devel25) using qt designer 3.1.2 to preserve backward
compatibility.

2004-05-18 [gsherman] 0.2.0devel25
Changes to implement scale display for map data in feets, meters, and
decimal degrees. A new menu item is added to the Tools menu for selecting
the map units. This setting is currently not saved with a project file.
TODO:Modify qgis.dtd and project save/load to support map units.

NOTE - the qgisapp.ui file was created with qt 3.3.x and WILL NOT WORK
with qt 3.1.2. This will be changed as soon as I can find my 3.1.2 version
of qt designer...

2004-05-18 [ts] 0.2.0devel24
Relax checking of raster filetype extensions to cater for filetypes where
extension is unpredictable (e.g. grass).
Now I use gdal to quickly check if a file is usable so pretty much anything
gdal iscompile with should get through if you have chosen wildcard
 filter in add raster dialog.
 
2004-05-17 [larsl] 0.2.0devel23
Added URL parsing and attribute fields for route and track GPX layers

2004-05-17 [ts] 0.2.0devel22
Added support to Save As Image to save in any QImageIO supported format.
File->SaveAsImage dialog filter list now generated automagically by
interrogating QImageIO for its supportted formats. File->SaveAsImage remembers
last dir used (stored in qsettings). Its supposed to remember last filter used
but there is an issue with that that needs to be resolved.

2004-05-16 [larsl] 0.2.0devel21
Added url/link parsing to the GPX provider

2004-05-16 [larsl] 0.2.0devel20

Added my picture in the About dialog to attract more female users to QGIS

2004-05-13 [ts] 0.2.0devel18
Raster properties changes: Switched order of general tab and symbology tab - as you normally change
straight to symbology tab anyway. Removed stats tab and consolidated stats
into metadata tab. Clean ups on metadata tab.

2004-05-13 [ts] 0.2.0devel17
Raster stats tab now displays pyramid/overview info

2004-05-14 [larsl] 0.2.0devel16

Added the basename of the GPX or LOC file in the layer name
Changed the plugin name to the more general "GPS Tools"

2004-05-14 [larsl] 0.2.0devel15
Fixed a bug that caused the canvas to have a fixed width of 400 with my
   Qt version - the main grid layout for the main window had one extra column

2004-05-14 [larsl] 0.2.0devel14
Added a tab for loading GPX and LOC files to the GPS plugin dialog

2004-05-14 [larsl] 0.2.0devel13
Added a virtual destructor to QgsDataProvider and deleted dataProvider in
   the destructor for QgsVectorLayer

2004-05-12 [ts] 0.2.0devel8
Added addProject(QString) to plugin interface.

2004-05-05 [jobi] 0.2.0devel7
Extended qgis-config to expose version

2004-05-04 [ts] 0.2.0devel6
Added two new internal plugins - North Arrow and Copyright message overlay

2004-05-03 [ts] 0.2.0devel5
Canvas now emits renderComplete signal when rendering of cnavas has completed,
but before the screen is refreshed. Added accessor and mutators for the canvas
pixmap.

2004-05-03 [ts] 0.2.0devel4
qgisApp->mapCanvas is now exposed through the plugin interface.

2004-05-03 [ts] 0.2.0devel3
Added three new widgets to status bar:
scale - which shows the scale in the form 1:50000 *
coordinates - shows coordinates of mouse on map in its own widget
progressbar - shows the progress of any task that emits signals connected to
showProgress slot

Added signal / slot mechanism for showExtents and set fp precision to 2 (see
below)

stringRep function in QgsRect and QgsPoint now overloaded to allow setting
floating point precision for display. QgisApp & canvas are currently hard
coding this to 2 but I plan to make this user configurable in the options
panel.

Added example of using progress indicator to raster stats gathering procedure.
You can see this in action by setting ak_shade example dataset to singleband
pseudocolor and you will see progress indicator advancing as stats are
gathered.

*NOTE: scale calculations may not be correct at this point - they are still
under development.

2004-04-27 [ts] 0.2.0devel2

Added preliminary support for building pyramids in raster files
using the GDAL overview function. Currently it is hard coded to use Nearest
neighbour algorithm with pyramids at levels  2, 4 and 8. Adding pyramids to
your raster layer can greatly improve rendering performance. This new
functionality is accessed by right clicking on a raster legen entry and
choosing 'Build Pyramids' from the popup menu.

*PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION *
This current implementation does not warn you of possible side effects
including:
- possible image degradation if too many pyramids are generated
- possuble large increase in image side
- currently this process IS NOT KNOWN TO BE REVERSIBLE so please backup data
first before experimenting.

2004-04-27 [ts] 0.2.0devel1

Rejigged single marker symbol so directory, icon selector, preview and 
   scaling widget are all in one panel rather than having to spawn a new
   window to select an icon.

2004-04-27 [ts] 0.2.0devel0

Fixed broken bits in internal plugin builder template and updated default
   plugin template gui,

added install routine for svg files
added new translations
adjusted paths in the cpp files

2004-04-19 [jobi] 0.1.0devel34
Changed to simple macros for detecting QT and GDAL
Added code for detecting QGIS as m4 file to tools
this will be installed together with QT and GDAL detection to
   $prefix/share/aclocal/qgis.m4
   so the plugins can just use those simple unique macros
updated German translation
!! Developers have to link the installed qgis.m4 to /usr/share/aclocal/
!! or where ever aclocal keeps the m4 files
!! otherwise it's not detected by the plugins autogen.sh (more exactly
!! aclocal)
!! It can be cheated by adding -I path/to/qgis.m4 to the aclocal of
!! autogen.sh. But be carefull not to commit that to CVS

2004-04-18 [jobi] 0.1.0devel33
Added internationalisations stuff
   Needs some documentation and more translations :-)

2004-04-17 [ts] 0.1.0devel32

Added version checks for autoconf, automake and libtool                                                                                                     
Small bugfixes                                                                                                                                       

2004-04-02 [mcoletti] 0.1.0devel26

Fix for cl parameter "snapshot" to ensure events are process (ie canvas is
drawn!) before snapshot is taken.

2004-03-27 [jobi] 0.1.0devel17
autogen.sh now passes parameters to configure
fixed tools/qgiscommit by using mktemp, thanx mcoletti

  $(prefix)/lib
"src/Makefile" no longer relies on explicit dependencies and uses better
  naming scheme for created source files

2004-03-21 [ts] 0.1.0devel7

Added thumbnail preview of raster to raster props dialog.
   Added drawThumbnail method to rasterlayer.cpp
   Split (overloaded) draw method in rasterlayer.cpp so that some parts of
   the original draw method could be used by drawThumbnail method too.

Fixed a bug in the drawing of pseudocolor single band grayscale images that
   prevented all class breaks being displayed.

    
2004-03-10 [gs] 0.1.0devel7
Added delimited text plugin which provides gui to add delimited text
   layers using the delimited_text data provider
Changes to delimited_text data provider to support zooming, display
   of attributes, and identifying features. Selecting features does
   not work at this time.
Auto* changes to support building the delimited text provider and
   plugin
Minor changes to QgsFeature

2004-03-06 [ts] 0.1.0devel6

   when qgis closes and reloaded in the next session).

2004-03-06 [ts] 0.1.0devel6
Save state of plugins in ~/.qt/qtrc file (in progress). State is saved,
   just need to implement code to load plugins marked as active during
   application startup.

2004-03-06 [ts] 0.1.0devel6
Added QgsRasterLayer::filterLayer which gets called near the end of each of
   the 8 renderers. This is the place to inline filters. Note that eventually filters 
   will be hived out to a filter plugin mechanism.

2004-03-06 [didge] 0.1.0devel6
Changed configure stuff to write DEFINES in config.h.
   Postgresql stuff needs testing as I commented the compileflags in src/Makefile.am
Infos will be posted on the devel mailinglist

2004-03-04 [ts] 0.1.0devel5
Added option to options dialog to disable splashscreen.

2004-02-28 [ts] 0.1.0devel5
- -snapshot command line parameter working now and correctly scaling
   snapshot to size of pixmap.
started moving splashscreen to a global so other classes diring  the startup 
   process can get access to set the splash status. (in progress)

2004-02-28 [gs] 0.1.0devel5
Refactored QgsField to use new coding conventions
Documented QgsField (added docs to qgsfield.h)
Updated doxygen mainpage section in qgis.h
Added Whats this? help to main application window
Added providers/delimitedtext and associated source files to CVS

2004-02-27 [gs] 0.1.0devel4
Corrected debug statements in main.cpp and added a bit of verbiage to the
   help text.
Removed hard coding of provider types in the QgisApp::addVectorLayer method.
  Caller must now provide compatible arguments that the designated provider can
  use to open the data store and fetch data. Changed QgsPgGeoprocessing class
  to properly call addVectorLayer.

2004-02-27 [ts]
Changed cl parser to getopt
   Moved project loading out of loop that loads layers - you now need to specify
   --project filename to load a filename. This ensures that you only try to load 
   one project file.
   Added --snapshot filename parameter that will load layers and project files
   specified, take a screenie of the map view and save it to disk as filename - 
   this is under construction still.
   Added saveMapAsImage(QString) to qgisapp so above cl option can be used.
 
2004-02-26 [ts]
Added a tab to raster layer properties dialog to show metadata about the
   raster layer (using gdal metadata)

July 26, 2002
  Drawing code now properly displays layers and calculates extents when
  zooming. Zoom is still fixed zoom in rather than interactive.
  
July 20, 2002
  Repaint automatic for layers.
  
July 18, 2002
  Point, line and polygon PostGis layers can be drawn. Still issues with
  map exent and positioning of layers on the canvas. Drawing is manual and
  not tied to the paint event. No zooming or panning yet.
  
July 10, 2002
  Layers can be selected and added to the map canvas collection however
  the rendering code is currently disabled and being reorganized. So if
  you add a layer, nothing will be drawn...
  
July 6, 2002
  This code is preliminary and really has no true functionality other than
  the ability to define a PostGIS connection and display the spatially enabled
  tables that could be loaded. 

  This is the initial import of the code base into CVS on Sourceforge.net.
