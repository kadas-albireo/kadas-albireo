<H1>4. Whats new in Version 2.0.1 'Dufour'?</H1>

<P>
This is a small bugfix release to address the missing copyright / credits for
our new splash screen and to update supporting documentation. The spanish 
translation was also updated.
</P>

<A NAME="toc5"></A>
<H1>5. Whats new in Version 2.0.0 'Dufour'?</H1>

<P>
This is a new major release. Building on the foundation of
QGIS 1.x.x releases, QGIS Dufour introduces many new features,
improvements and bug fixes. Here is a summary of some of the
key new features.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>We have updated out icon theme to use the 'GIS' theme which introduces
      an improved level of consistency and professionalism to the QGIS user
      interface.
<LI>The new symbol layer overview uses a clear, tree-structured layout
      which allows for easy and fast access to all symbol layers.
<LI>QGIS 2.0 now includes Oracle Spatial support.
<LI>With the new data defined properties, it is possible to control symbol
      type, size, color, rotation, and many other properties through feature
      attributes.
<LI>You can now place html elements onto your map.
<LI>Having nicely aligned map items is critical to making nice printed
      maps. Auto snapping lines have been added to allow for easy composer
      object alignment by simply dragging an object close to another.
<LI>Sometimes you need to align objects a curtain distance on the composer.
      With the new manual snapping lines you are able to add manual snap lines
      which allow for better align objects using a common alignment. Simply
      drag from the top or side ruler to add new guide line.
<LI>Ever needed to generate a map series? Of course you have. The composer
      now includes built in map series generation using the atlas feature.
      Coverage layers can be points, lines, polygons, and the current feature
      attribute data is available in labels for on the fly value replacement.
<LI>A single composer window can now contain more then one page.
<LI>The composer label item in 1.8 was quite limited and only allowed a single
      token $CURRENT_DATE to be used. In 2.0 full expression support has been
      added too greater power and control of the final labels.
<LI>The map frame now contains the ability to show the extents of another
      map and will update when moved. Using this with the atlas generation
      feature now core in the composer allows for some slick map generation.
      Overview frame style uses the same styling as a normal map polygon
      object so your creativity is never restricted.
<LI>Layer blending makes it possible to combine layers in new and exciting
      ways. While in older versions, all you could do was to make the layer
      transparent, you can now choose between much more advanced options such as
      "multiply", "darken only", and many more. Blending can be used in the
      normal map view as well as in print composer.
<LI>HTML support has been added map composer label item to give you even
      more control over your final maps. HTML labels support full css styles
      sheets, html, and even javascript if you are that way inclined.
<LI>The labelling system has been totally overhauled - it now includes many
      new features such as drop shadows, 'highway shields', many more data bound
      options, and various performance enhancements. We are slowly doing away
      with the 'old labels' system, although you will still find that
      functionality available for this release, you should expect that it will
      disappear in a follow up release.
<LI>The full power of normal label and rule expressions can now be used for
      label properties. Nearly every property can be defined with an expression
      or field value giving you more control over the label result. Expressions
      can refer to a field (e.g. set the font size to the value of the field
      'font') or can include more complex logic. Examples of bindable
      properties include: Font, Size, Style and Buffer size.
<LI>With the expression engine being used more and more though out QGIS to
      allow for things like expression based labels and symbol, many more
      functions have been added to the expression builder and are all accessible
      though the expression builder. All functions include comprehensive help
      and usage guides for ease of use.
<LI>If the expression engine doesn't have the function that you need. Not to
      worry. New functions can be added via a plugin using a simple Python API.
<LI>The Python API has been revamped to allow for a more cleaner, more
      pythonic, programming experience. The QGIS 2.0 API uses SIP V2 which
      removes the messy toString(), toInt() logic that was needed when working
      with values. Types are now converted into native Python types making for a
      much nicer API. Attributes access is now done on the feature itself using
      a simple key lookup, no more index lookup and attribute maps.
      <B>Note:</B> Most plugins written for QGIS &lt; 1.x will need to be
        ported to work correctly in QGIS 2.x. Please consult
        <A HREF="http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Python_plugin_API_changes_from_18_to_20">http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Python_plugin_API_changes_from_18_to_20</A>
        for more details.
<LI>The raster data provider system has been completely overhauled. One of
      the best new features stemming from this work is the ability to 'Layer -&gt;
      Save As...' to save any raster layer as a new layer. In the process you
      can clip, resample, and reproject the layer to a new Coordinate Reference
      System. You can also save a raster layer as a rendered image so if you for
      example have single band raster that you have applied a color palette to,
      you can save the rendered layer out to a georeferenced RGB layer.
<LI>There are many, many more new features  in QGIS 2.0 - we invite
      you to explore the software and discover them all!
</UL>

<A NAME="toc6"></A>
<H1>6. Whats new in Version 1.8.0 'Lisboa'?</H1>

<P>
This is a new feature release. Building on the foundation of
QGIS 1.7.x releases, Lisboa introduces many new features,
improvements and bug fixes. Here is a summary of some of the
key new features.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>QGIS Browser - a stand alone app and a new panel in QGIS. The browser lets you easily navigate your file system and connection based (PostGIS, WFS etc.) datasets, preview them and drag and drop items into the canvas.
<LI>DB Manager - the DB manager is now officially part of QGIS core. You can drag layers from the QGIS Browser into DB Manager and it will import your layer into your spatial database. Drag and drop tables between spatial databases and they will get imported. You can use the DB Manager to execute SQL queries against your spatial database and then view the spatial output for queries by adding the results to QGIS as a query layer.
<LI>Action Tool - now there is a tool on the map tools toolbar that will allow you to click on a vector feature and execute an action.
<LI>MSSQL Spatial Support - you can now connect to your Microsoft SQL Server spatial databases using QGIS.

<H1>9. Whats new in Version 1.7.0 'Wroclaw'?</H1>

<P>
This release is named after the town of Wroclaw in Poland. The Department of
Climatology and Atmosphere Protection, University of Wroclaw kindly hosted our
developer meeting in November 2010. Please note that this is a release in
our 'cutting edge' release series. As such it contains new features and extends
the programmatic interface over QGIS 1.0.x and QGIS 1.6.0. As with any
software, there may be bugs and issues that we were not able to fix in time for
the release. We therefore recommend that you test this version before rolling
it out en-masse to your users.
</P>
<P>
This release includes over 277 bug fixes and many new features and
enhancements. Once again it is impossible to document everything here that has
changed so we will just provide a bullet list of key new features here.
</P>

<A NAME="toc12"></A>
<H1>12. Whats new in Version 1.4.0 'Enceladus'?</H1>

<P>
Please note that this is a release in our 'cutting edge' release series. As
such it contains new features and extends the programmatic interface over QGIS
1.0.x and QGIS 1.3.0. If an unchanging user interface, programmatic API and
long term support is more important to you then cool new and untested features,
we recommend that you use a copy of QGIS from our Long Term Support (LTS)1.0.x
release series. In all other cases we recommend that you use this version.
</P>
<P>
This release includes around 200 bug fixes, nearly 30 new features and has had
a lot of love and attention poured in to it to take our favourite desktop GIS
application another step on the road to GIS nirvana! So much has happened in
the 3 months since our last release that it is impossible to document
everything here. Instead we will just highlight a couple of important new
features for you.
</P>
<P>
Probably the biggest new feature is the addition of the new vector symbology
infrastructure. This is provided alongside the old implementation - you can
switch using a button in the vector layer properties dialog. It does't replace
the old symbology implementation completely yet because there are various isues
that need to be resolved and a large amount of testinhen it is considered
ready.
</P>
<P>
QGIS now has a field calculator, accessible via a button in the attribute
section of the vector properties, and from the attribute table user interface.
You can use feature length, feature area, string concatenation and type
conversions in the field calculator, as well as field values.
</P>
<P>
The map composer has had a lot of attention. A grid can now be added to
composer maps. Composer maps can now be rotated in the layout. The limitation
of a single map layout per project has been removed. A new composer manager
dialog has been added to manage the existing composer instances. The composer
widget property sheets have been completely overhauled to use less screen space 
</P>
<P>
Various parts of the user interface have been overhauled with the goal of
improving consistency and to improve support for netbooks and other smaller
screen devices. Loading and saving of shortcuts. Position can now be displayed
as Degrees, Minutes, Seconds in the status bar. The add, move and delete vertex
buttons are now removed and the node tool is moved from the advanced editing
toolbar to the standard editing toolbar. The identification tool has also
undergone numerous improvements.
</P>
<P>
A render caching capability has been added to QGIS. This speeds up common
operations such as layer re-ordering, changing symbology, WMS / WFS client,
hiding / showing layers and opens the door for future enhancements such as
threaded rendering and pre-compositing layer cache manipulation. Note that it
is disabled by default, and can be enabled in the options dialog.
</P>
<P>
User defined SVG search paths are now added to the options dialog.
</P>
<P>
When creating a new shapefile, you can now specify its CRS. Also the avoid
intersections option for polygons is now also possible with background layers.
</P>
<P>
For power users, you can now create customizable attribute forms using Qt
Designer dialog UIs.
</P>

<A NAME="toc13"></A>
<H1>13. Whats new in Version 1.3.0 'Mimas'?</H1>

<P>
This release includes over 30 bug fixes and several useful new features:
</P>

<H2>13.1. OSM plugin &amp;amp; provider updates</H2>

</UL>

<A NAME="toc14"></A>
<H1>14. Version 1.2.0 'Daphnis'</H1>

<P>
Please note that this is a release in our 'cutting edge' release series. As 
such it contains new features and extends the programmatic interface over 
QGIS 1.0.x. If stability and long term support is more important to you 
then cool new and untested features, we recommend that you use a copy 
of QGIS from our stable 1.0.x release series.
This release includes over 140 bug fixes and enchancements 
over the QGIS 1.1.0 release. In addition we have added 
the following new features:
</P>

<H2>14.1. Editing</H2>

<P>
Editing functionality in QGIS has had a major update in this release. This
includes the addition of new vector editing tools:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>delete part of multipart feature
<LI>delete hole from polygon
<LI>simplify feature
<LI>Added a new "node" tool (in advanced digitizing toolbar).
<LI>New functionality for merging features
<LI>Added undo/redo functionality for vector layer editing.
<LI>Added option to show only markers of selected features in editing mode.
<LI>Change layer's icon in legend to reflext that the layer is editable.
</UL>

<P>
In addition, there are undo/redo actions in Edit menu, in Advanced digitizing toolbar
and there is a new dock widget displaying undo stack of active layer.
</P>
<P>
About the node tool: It resembles a tool for editing paths by nodes that is
present in every vector editor. How does it work (in QGIS)? Click on a
feature, its nodes will be marked by small rectangles. Clicking and dragging a
node moves it. Double clicking a segment will add a new node. Pressing delete
key will remove active node. It's possible to select more active nodes at
once: by clicking and dragging a rectangle. It's possible to select a segment's
adjacent nodes by clicking on the segment. It's possible to add/remove active
nodes by using Ctrl when clicking a node or dragging a rectangle
</P>
<P>
We recommend that you turn off vertex markers in QGIS options when working with
this tool: the redraws are much faster and the map is not cluttered with
markers. 
</P>

<H2>14.2. Keyboard shortcuts</H2>

<P>
New feature: configure shortcuts for actions within main window of qgis!
See menu Setting-&gt;Configure shortcuts
</P>

composer map extent to the map canvas extent. possibility to display
current date in composer label by typing (d 'June' yyyy) or similar.
It is now possible to keep the current layers in a composer map even if further
layers are added to the main map. Export to PDF in composer is now possible.
</P>

<H2>14.4. Attribute tables</H2>

<P>
It is now possible to search the attribute table within selected records only.
General speedups have been made on the attribute table. Setting of field width
and precision when adding attributes is now possible. Handling of attribute
types in WFS provider has bee improved.
</P>
<P>
Attribute aliases for vector layers are now available. The aliases are shown
instead of the original field names in the info tool and attribute table to
make things easier for end users. There is now a GUI for setting edit widgets
for layer attributes.  A new dialog allows loading a value map from a layer
(could be non-spatial table too!).  The edit widgets settings will also now
be respected in the attribute table.
</P>

<H2>14.5. Plugins</H2>

<UL>
<LI>The order of layers in the WMS dialog can now be changed.
<LI>The eVis plugin, version 1.1.0, has been added to the QGIS project and

<UL>
<LI>2005-07-03 [morb_au] 0.7.devel2 Merged changes in the 0.7 release
candidate branch (as at "Release-0_7-candidate-pre1") back into the trunk.
<LI>2005-05-23 [gsherman] 0.7rc1 Fixed bookmarks bug related to non-existent user database. The

<LI>2005-04-21 [timlinux] 0.6devel25 More updates to qgsspatialrefsys. Changed splash to be a masked widget &amp;
added the xcf masters for the splash. Splash still needs some minor
updating relating to text placement.
<LI>2005-04-20 [timlinux] 0.6devel24 Added logic for reverse mapping a wkt or proj4string to an srsid - not

   macros in qgsspit.h and qgsattributetable.h
<LI>2005-01-01 [larsl] 0.6.0devel4 Fixed a bug that crashed QGIS when loading rasters from a project file, pt 2
<LI>2005-01-01 [larsl] 0.6.0devel3 Fixed a bug that crashed QGIS when loading rasters from a project file
<LI>2004-12-30 [mcoletti] 0.6.0devel2 *Re-factored endian-handling in data providers
 <UL>
 <LI>Re-factored delimited text provider 
 <LI>Made some class members const-correct
 </UL>
<LI>2004-12-30 [larsl] 0.6.0devel1 Implemented getProjectionWKT() in QgsGPXProvider
<LI>2004-12-19 [gsherman] 0.6.0rc2 Updated README Added main.cpp so spit builds as standalone and plugin. Makefile.am modified
 so spit binary installs in PREFIX dir
<LI>2004-12-19 [timlinux] 0.6.0rc2 Added Slovak translation from Lubos Balazovic
 Massive documentation updates Updates to developer pictures and the about box
<LI>2004-12-19 [mhugent] providers/ogr/qgsshapefileprovider.cpp: fix for attribute problem
    in ogr provider
<LI>2004-12-05 [gsherman] 0.6.0rc2 Fixed bug 1079392 that caused QGIS to crash when a query was entered that
 resulted in the layer being created with no records. Additional validation
 of the SQL query was added to the query builder.  When Ok is clicked on
 the builder dialog, the query is sent to the database and the result
 checked to ensure that it will create a valid PostreSQL layer.  Added tr
 to a number of strings that weren't prepared for translation in the vector
 dialog properties code Created QgsDataSourceURI structure to hold all the
 pertinent information associated with a PostgreSQL layer connection,
 including host, database, table, geometry column, username, password,
 port, and sql where clause.
<LI>2004-12-03 [gsherman] 0.6.0rc1 Commented out excessive debug statements in the postgres provider
<LI>2004-12-03 [gsherman] 0.6.0rc1 Changing the SQL query for a PostgreSQL
 layer using the query builder from the vector layer properties dialog now
 properly updates the mapcanvas extents and feature count.
 Fix for crash in pg buffer plugin (bug 1077412). Crash is due to the
 addition of sql where clause support in the postgres provider. The provider
 was not checking to see if a sql key was included in the datasource uri and
 thus copying the entire URI as the where clause.
 The .shp extension is now added the new vector layer name (if not specified
 by the user).  The .qgs extension is now added to a project file when using
 save or save as (if not specified by the user).

<H1>23. 0.5</H1>

<UL>
<LI>2004-12-01 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel30 Added functions to qgsdataprovider.h to support updating the feature count
 and extents. To be supported, these functions must be implemented in the data
 provider implementation. The default implementations don't do anything useful.
<LI>QgsVectorLayer now has functions for requesting feature count, extent
 update, and the subset defintiion string (usually sql) from the underlying
 data provider. Providers do not need to implement these functions unless
 they want to support subsetting the layer via a layer definition query or
 other means.
<P></P>
2004-11-27 [larsl] 0.5.0devel30
Fixed feature addition in GPX layers, it now works again
<P></P>
2004-11-22 [mcoletti] 0.5.0devel29
QgsProject properties now re-designed to be similar to QSettings
<P></P>
2004-11-20 [timlinux] 0.5.0devel28
Added the capability to interrupt the rendering of the currently drawing map
layer by pressing the escape key. Repeat and rinse to interrupt drawing of all
vector layers. Not implemented for raster layers yet.
<P></P>
2004-11-11 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel27
First pass at a PostgreSQL query builder. This is not entirely
   functional yet. Fields for a table are displayed and sample or all
   values can be displayed. Double-clicking on a field name or sample
   value pastes it into the sql query box at the current cursor
   position. The test function is not implemented yet nor is the type
   checking to allow auto quoting of text values in the sql statement.
<P></P>
2004-11-19 [mcoletti] 0.5.devel26
Changed QgsProject properties interface to be more similar to
   QSettings.  New properties are emitted to file.  There is a known
   bug with QStringLists in that thre're redundant copies written to
   the file.  New properties aren't read yet.  Will be adding code
   for that over next couple days.
<P></P>
2004-11-17 [timlinux] 0.5.0devel25
Added a little checkbox to the bottom right of status bar that 
when checked will suppress rendering of layers in main canvas 
and overview canvas, This is useful if you want to load a bunch 
of layers and tweak their symbology etc without having delays 
caused by rerendering everything after each change you make.
<P></P>
2004-11-16 [larsl] 0.5.0devel24
Reimplemented nextFeature() so features are visible again
<P></P>
2004-11-13 [larsl] 0.5.0devel23
Changed QgsIdentifyResults and QgsVectorLayer to show all attributes
   automatically (expand the feature node) if only one feature is identified
<P></P>
2004-11-11 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel22
Added ifdef's for WIN32 around dynamic_casts in the vector renderer
  dialogs. Even though rtti is enabled, use of dynamic casts causes seg
  faults under WIN32.
<P></P>
2004-11-09 [timlinux] 0.5.0devel21
Added options to graticule builder to allow you to define origin and
enpoints and to set the graticule size at &lt; 1 degree. Note that there is
little error checking in there still, so putting in dodgy numbers may cause
qgis to crash.
<P></P>
2004-11-04 [timlinux] 0.5.0devel20
Added scale dependent visibility support to both raster and vector layers.
<P></P>
2004-11-02 [larsl] 0.5.0devel19
Added menu item for creating an empty GPX file
<P></P>
2004-10-31 [timlinux] 0.5.0devel18

<P></P>
2004-10-30 [larsl] 0.5.0devel17
qgsfeature.h is needed in qgsvectordataprovider.cpp since it's deleting
   a QgsFeature, fixed it
<P></P>
2004-10-29 [larsl] 0.5.0devel16
Added defaultValue() in QgsVectorLayer and QgsVectorDataProvider,
   implemented it in the GPX provider
<P></P>
2004-10-29 [stevehalasz] 0.5.0devel15
* Write layers to projects files in the proper order by iterating over the
  zOrder in the map canvas. Fixes bug #1054332.
<P></P>
* Remove the &lt;zorder&gt; tag from the dtd. It is superfluous.
<P></P>
2004-10-26 [mcoletti] 0.5.0devel13
regarding saving and restoring units in project files.

<P></P>
2004-10-22 [larsl] 0.5.0devel12
Removed more unused code in the GPS plugin, changed the GPS plugin source
   to follow the coding standards better
<P></P>
2004-10-22 [larsl] 0.5.0devel11
Some changes in the GPS plugin:
   * Changed the tooltip of the action from "GPS Importer" to "GPS Tools"
   * Removed some old unused code
   * Made the upload/download tools much more flexible by letting users
     specifying "devices" with upload and download commands
   * Remember the last used device and port for uploads and downloads
   * Remember the last directory that a GPX file was loaded from
<P></P>
2004-10-20 [mcoletti] 0.5.0devel10
merged in qgsproject-branch

2004-10-18 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel7
Added test for GEOS to acinclude.m4 and configure.in
Added members/methods in preparation for support of scale dependent
   rendering
Added Display tab to the vector dialog to allow setting of min and max
   scales for rendering 
<P></P>
2004-10-18 [larsl] 0.5.0devel6
Removed duplicate code, added bounds calculation for digitized features in the GPX provider
<P></P>
2004-10-18 [larsl] 0.5.0devel5
Changes to the GPX provider:
   * Implemented isEditable(), isModified(), commitChanges(), and rollBack()
   * Removed the useless lat and lon attributes in waypoint features
   * Cleaned up the attribute parsing in addFeature()
   GPX editing should now work again.
<P></P>
2004-10-17 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel4
OGR provider now uses GEOS to select features when doing identify and
   select operations.
<P></P>
2004-10-16 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel3
Fixed OGR filters in the add layer dialog box using fix in qgsproject-branch
Reverted images in qgisappbase.ui to XPM so QGIS will compile on Qt &lt; 3.x
<P></P>
2004-10-11 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel2
Added man page (qgis.man) that gets installed in man1 as qgis.1
<P></P>
2004-10-09 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel1
Changed name to Simon
Added Simon splash screen
Fixed command line loading bug to eliminate bogus warning for vector layers
Modified splashscreen.cpp to allow specification of x,y for text drawing on
   the splash image
Imperfectly fixed problem where postgis attributes aren't displayed if the
   primary key is not of type int4 (bug 1042706).
Added Latvian translation file (untranslated at present)
<P></P>
2004-09-23 [larsl] 0.4.0devel38
Removed support for loading Geocaching.com LOC files
<P></P>
2004-09-20 [tim] 0.4.0devel37
Shameless acknowledge not keeping this file up to date!
Sort out clipping problems with labeller

2004-09-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel36
Added the element definition of uniquevaluemarker to qgis.dtd
<P></P>
2004-09-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel35
Re-fixed bug 987874, the provider will now skip geometry-less features
   but keep reading other features
<P></P>
2004-09-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel34
Fixed bug 987874 which caused QGIS to crash when showing the attribute
   table for shapefile layers with features with NULL geometry 
   (GetGeometryRef() returns NULL) - the OGR provider now treats features
   with NULL geometry as NULL features, i.e. EOF
<P></P>
2004-09-15 [larsl] 0.4.0devel33
Fixed QgsUValMaDialogBase so the listbox doesn't take up all of the space

Scale down SVG symbols
Display rasters without geotransform info as "1 pixel = 1 unit"
<P></P>
2004-09-12 [larsl] 0.4.0devel29
Fixed bug in scale_bar plugin that would cause QGIS to freeze when a
   layer with one point was loaded
<P></P>
2004-09-12 [larsl] 0.4.0devel28
The device lists in the GPS plugin should show /dev/ttyUSB* devices too
   now (for serial USB adapters) on Linux

2004-09-01 [mcoletti] 0.4.0devel25
QgsRect : 
<P></P>
  <UL>
  <LI>no longer waste copy of QgsPoint in ctor
  <P></P>
2004-08-14 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel23
Moved plugin toolbar to the qgisappbase toolbar container rather than
  dynamically allocating it. This allows the state/docking position gets
  restored each time the app starts.
  <P></P>
2004-08-26 [mcoletti] 0.4.0devel22
qgisapp.cpp:
  <P></P>
  </UL>

qgsprojectio.cpp:
<P></P>
 <UL>
 <LI>minor code change; commented out superfluous code
 <P></P>
2004-08-26 [mcoletti] 0.4.0devel21
Now explicitly check for command line arguments via $# instead of $@.  Using
$@ caused the script to crash when more than one command line argument was
passed in.  (E.g., specifying multiple files for CVS commits.)
 <P></P>
2004-08-25 [mcoletti] 0.4.0devel20
Now explicitly use QgsMapLayerRegistry instance instead of data members.  (Of
which two both referred to the same instance.)
 <P></P>
2004-08-25 [mcoletti] 0.4.0devel19
Deleted two data members that referred to the Singleton object
QgsMapLayerRegistry.  Now explicitly use QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance(),
which emphasizes that you're accessing a Singleton.
 <P></P>
2004-08-22 [larsl] 0.4.0devel18
Fixed a bug that caused SVG markers to be huge when oversampling was turned on
 <P></P>
2004-08-22 [larsl] 0.4.0devel17
Fixed transparency in SVG sumbols
 <P></P>
2004-08-21 [larsl] 0.4.0devel16
Added a black frame around the white rectangle around SVG symbols to make it look cleaner, can be removed when transparency is fixed
 <P></P>
2004-08-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel15
Added more attribute fields to the GPX provider: cmt, desc, src, sym, number, urlname
 <P></P>
2004-08-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel14
Forgot to calculate bounds for user-added routes and tracks in the GPX
   provider, which caused unpredictable drawing bugs since selection wouldn't
   work. Fixed.
 <P></P>
2004-08-14 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel13
Moved common toobar icons to drop-down tool menus. This includes the
   overview, hide/show all, and capture tools
 <P></P>
2004-08-18 [jobi] 0.4.0devel12
added Italian translation thanx to Maurizio Napolitano
updated all translations
 <P></P>
2004-08-17 [larsl] 0.4.0devel11
Implemented GPX file writing - GPX layers are now written back to file
   when features are added
 <P></P>
2004-08-17 [larsl] 0.4.0devel10
* More digitizing support for the GPX provider. Routes and tracks can now be 
  created. Nothing is written to file yet.
 <P></P>
2004-08-14 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel9
Added mouse wheel zoom. Moving wheel forward zooms in by a factor of 2.
 <P></P>
2004-08-12 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel8
Rearranged capture icons and added them to the MapNavigation action group
   so that the icons remain depressed while the tool is active. (bugs
   994274 and 994272)
Fixed preferences bug (992458) that caused themes to disappear when setting
   options.
 <P></P>
2004-07-19 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel7
Fixed broken setDisplayField function in qgsvectorlayer
Added display/label field handling. Field is now set when the layer is
   added by examining the fields and attempting to make a "smart" choice. The
   user can later change this field from the layer properties dialog. This field
   is used as the item name in the identify box (top of the tree for each feature
   and its attributes) and will eventually be used in labelling features.
Cleanup of postgres add layer dialog 
Removed excessive debug output from qgsfeature 
 <P></P>
2004-07-18 [larsl] 0.4.0devel6
Changed Graduated Marker renderer to use the SVG cache
 <P></P>
2004-07-17 [larsl] 0.4.0devel5
Added SVG cache and started using it in the Single Marker renderer
 <P></P>
2004-07-10 [larsl] 0.4.0devel4
Added code to QgsProjectIo that saves and loads the provider key of a vector
   layer in the project file, so delimited text layers and GPX layers can be
   saved in a project. Haven't tested for grass vector layers, but it should
   work.
 <P></P>
2004-07-09 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel3
First pass at defining PostgreSQL layers using a where clause in the
   data provider. UI may need some work. When adding a PG layer, double-

 <P></P>
2004-06-23 [mcoletti] 0.3.0devel50
Fixed bug whereby one couldn't downcast from QgsMapLayer* to a
QgsVectorLayer*.  Apparently this was because dlopen()'d files didn't have
full access to global variables.  Now plug-ins can use global variable by
linking with -rdynamic and using dlopen()'s RTLD_GLOBAL flag.
 <P></P>
2004-06-21 [ts] 0.3.0devel49
 <P></P>
Revised raster stats emiting of progress update to not do it when stats are

Beginnings of generic vector file writer - incomplete and doesnt do anything useful 
   yet except has abilty to make a shapefile with a couple of user defined fields e.g.

2004-06-16 [ts] 0.3.0devel39
Added small icon displayed on raster legend showing whether this layer is in overview 
   or not. This icon needs "petification!". Need to do the ame for vector once I figure 
   out where to put the code!'
</P>
<P>
2004-06-16 [ts] 0.3.0devel38
Added new menu / toolbar option to add all loaded layers into the overview.
</P>
<P>
2004-06-15 [larsl] 0.3.0devel37
More preparation for GPS upload code
New function in QgisInterface - getLayerRegistry()
</P>
<P>
2004-06-14 [ts] 0.3.0devel36
Added capability for plugins to clear the current project ignoring 
   the project dirty flag (ie force new project).
</P>
<P>
2004-06-14 [ts] 0.3.0devel35
Added addRasterLayer(QgsRasterLayer *) to the plugin interface. This allows plugins 
   to construct their own raster object, set its symbolisation and the pass it over 
   to the app to be loaded into the canvas.
</P>
<P>
2004-06-13 [ts] 0.3.0devel34
Removed gdal deps in qgisapp.
</P>
<P>
Moved raster load stuff to a group at the end of qgisapp.cpp file.
</P>
<P>
Removed generically usable raster fns from qgisapp to static methods of qgsrasterlayer.
</P>
<P>
Some renaming of variable names etc.

Add version name to splash
</P>
<P>
2004-06-13 [ts] 0.3.0devel31
Implemented a new map cursor type : Capture Point (little pencil icon on your toolbar). 
   At the moment clicking on the map in capture point mode will cause QgsMapCanvas to emit 
   an xyClickCoordinate(QgsPoint) signal which is picked up by qgisapp and the coordinates
   are placed into the system clipboard. 
</P>
<P>
  In release 0.5 this will be extended to provide simple point vector file data capture / 
  digitising facility. This will be implemented by means of a plugin which will utilise the 
  aforementioned xyClickCoordinate(QgsPoint) signal.
</P>
<P>
2004-06-12 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel30
Windows support -- lots of changes

Let the user choose GPS protocol and feature type to download
</P>
<P>
2004-06-10 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel28
Added display of extent rectangle in the overview map. Current
   implementation is not optimized (requires repaint of the overview canvas to
   display updated rectangle)
Added acetate layer support to the map canvas. Currently there is only one
   acetate object type - QgsAcetateRectangle, which inherits from
   QgsAcetateObject. More acetate types will follow...
</P>
<P>
2004-06-10 [ts] 0.3.0devel27
Modified projectio (serialisation and deserialisation of project files) to
   use maplayerregistry and not mapcanvas.
</P>

Added color selection for scale bar.
</P>
<P>
2004-06-09 [mcoletti] 0.3.0devel25

<P>
Did plumbing for enableing disabling layers in overview from popup context menu.
</P>
<P>
Whoopdeedooo. :-)
</P>
<P>
All that remains to do now is sort out syncronisation of layer ordering between main map canvas and overview canvas.
</P>
<P>
2004-06-09 [ts] 0.3.0devel22
Fixed bug that causes qgis to crash when an empty .dbf is encountered.
Added transparency slider to raster popup menu.

Hid the "GPS download file importer" tab
</P>
<P>
2004-06-08 [larsl] 0.3.0devel20
Call GPSBabel using QProcess instead of system(), show a progress bar while
   GPSBabel is running, show the messages printed to GPSBabel's stderr if
   something goes wrong
</P>
<P>
2004-06-08 [larsl] 0.3.0devel19
Started adding GPS data download capability. Only tracklogs from Garmin
   devices for now, routes and waypoints and Magellan support will come in
   the near future.
</P>
<P>
2004-06-08 [jobi] 0.3.0devel18

added translation support to external help applications (grid_maker and gpsimporter)
</P>
<P>
2004-06-07 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel17
Added update threshold to user options. Update threshold defines the number
   features to read before updating the map display (canvas). If set to zero
   the display is not updated until all features have been read.
</P>
<P>
2004-06-07 [larsl] 0.3.0devel16
Changed some calls to QMessageBox::question() to QMessageBox::information()
   since Qt 3.1.2 doesn't have question()
</P>
<P>
2004-06-07 [ts] 0.3.0devel15
Implemented map overview using maplayers rather than snapshots of a raster layer.
</P>
<P>
Implemented QgsMapLayerRegistry  - s singleton object that keeps track of
   loaded layers. When a layer is added an entry is made in the registry. When a
   layer is removed, the registry emits a layerWillBeRemoved signal that is
   connected to any mapvcanvas, legend etc that may be using the layer. The
   objects using the layer can then remove any reference they make to the layer -
   after which the registry deletes the layer object.
</P>
<P>
This fixes a problem with adding an overview map which caused qgis to crash
   when a layer was removed because it was trying to delete the same pointer
   twice.
</P>
<P>
Added a better implementation of the overview map below map legend.
</P>
<P>
Refactoring in qgis app - all private members now adhere to qgis naming
   conventions (prefixed with m).

Added theme selection to the user preferences dialog. Currently there
   is only one theme (default) available
</P>
<P>
2004-05-26 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel4
Added theme support for loading png icons during startup. This solves
   ugly icon problem when encoded as xpm in the ui files. See comments
   in the QgisApp::settheme() function for details
</P>
<P>
2004-05-26 [larsl] 0.3.0devel3
Added some calls to std::string::c_str() to hopefully make Qt without STL 
   happy
</P>
<P>
2004-05-26 [larsl] 0.3.0devel2
</P>
<P>
2004-05-26 [larsl] 0.3.0devel1
Fixed a bug that caused the legend checkboxes to always be unchecked when

</P>
<P>
2004-05-25 [larsl] 0.2.0devel37
Show the legend widgets in debug mode too

2004-05-20 [ts] 0.2.0devel31
First working version for gui pyramid manager (implemented as tab in raster
props). Raster legend entry now stretched to width of legend and show an icon

</P>
<P>
2004-05-20 [ts] 0.2.0devel28
Changed splash to load picture from file instead of an xpm include. This

compatibility.
</P>
<P>
2004-05-18 [gsherman] 0.2.0devel25
Changes to implement scale display for map data in feets, meters, and
decimal degrees. A new menu item is added to the Tools menu for selecting
the map units. This setting is currently not saved with a project file.
TODO:Modify qgis.dtd and project save/load to support map units.
</P>
<P>
NOTE - the qgisapp.ui file was created with qt 3.3.x and WILL NOT WORK
with qt 3.1.2. This will be changed as soon as I can find my 3.1.2 version
of qt designer...
</P>
<P>
2004-05-18 [ts] 0.2.0devel24
Relax checking of raster filetype extensions to cater for filetypes where
extension is unpredictable (e.g. grass).
Now I use gdal to quickly check if a file is usable so pretty much anything
gdal iscompile with should get through if you have chosen wildcard
 filter in add raster dialog.
</P>
<P>
2004-05-17 [larsl] 0.2.0devel23
Added URL parsing and attribute fields for route and track GPX layers
</P>
<P>
2004-05-17 [ts] 0.2.0devel22
Added support to Save As Image to save in any QImageIO supported format.
File-&gt;SaveAsImage dialog filter list now generated automagically by
interrogating QImageIO for its supportted formats. File-&gt;SaveAsImage remembers
last dir used (stored in qsettings). Its supposed to remember last filter used
but there is an issue with that that needs to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
2004-05-16 [larsl] 0.2.0devel21
Added url/link parsing to the GPX provider

<P>
2004-05-14 [larsl] 0.2.0devel15
Fixed a bug that caused the canvas to have a fixed width of 400 with my

<P>
2004-05-03 [ts] 0.2.0devel4
qgisApp-&gt;mapCanvas is now exposed through the plugin interface.
</P>
<P>
2004-05-03 [ts] 0.2.0devel3
Added three new widgets to status bar:
scale - which shows the scale in the form 1:50000 *
coordinates - shows coordinates of mouse on map in its own widget
progressbar - shows the progress of any task that emits signals connected to
showProgress slot
</P>
<P>
Added signal / slot mechanism for showExtents and set fp precision to 2 (see
below)
</P>
<P>
stringRep function in QgsRect and QgsPoint now overloaded to allow setting
floating point precision for display. QgisApp &amp; canvas are currently hard
coding this to 2 but I plan to make this user configurable in the options
panel.
</P>
<P>
Added example of using progress indicator to raster stats gathering procedure.
You can see this in action by setting ak_shade example dataset to singleband
pseudocolor and you will see progress indicator advancing as stats are
gathered.
</P>
<P>
*NOTE: scale calculations may not be correct at this point - they are still
under development.
</P>
<P>
2004-04-27 [ts] 0.2.0devel2
</P>
<P>
Added preliminary support for building pyramids in raster files
using the GDAL overview function. Currently it is hard coded to use Nearest
neighbour algorithm with pyramids at levels  2, 4 and 8. Adding pyramids to
your raster layer can greatly improve rendering performance. This new
functionality is accessed by right clicking on a raster legen entry and
choosing 'Build Pyramids' from the popup menu.
</P>
<P>
*PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION *
This current implementation does not warn you of possible side effects
including:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>possible image degradation if too many pyramids are generated
<LI>possuble large increase in image side
<LI>currently this process IS NOT KNOWN TO BE REVERSIBLE so please backup data
first before experimenting.

2004-04-19 [jobi] 0.1.0devel34
Changed to simple macros for detecting QT and GDAL
Added code for detecting QGIS as m4 file to tools
this will be installed together with QT and GDAL detection to
   $prefix/share/aclocal/qgis.m4
   so the plugins can just use those simple unique macros
updated German translation
!! Developers have to link the installed qgis.m4 to /usr/share/aclocal/
!! or where ever aclocal keeps the m4 files
!! otherwise it's not detected by the plugins autogen.sh (more exactly
!! aclocal)
!! It can be cheated by adding -I path/to/qgis.m4 to the aclocal of
!! autogen.sh. But be carefull not to commit that to CVS
</P>
<P>
2004-04-18 [jobi] 0.1.0devel33

<P>
2004-03-21 [ts] 0.1.0devel7
</P>
<P>
Added thumbnail preview of raster to raster props dialog.

   when qgis closes and reloaded in the next session).
</P>
<P>
2004-03-06 [ts] 0.1.0devel6
Save state of plugins in ~/.qt/qtrc file (in progress). State is saved,

</P>
<P>
2004-03-06 [ts] 0.1.0devel6
Added QgsRasterLayer::filterLayer which gets called near the end of each of

   will be hived out to a filter plugin mechanism.
</P>
<P>
2004-03-06 [didge] 0.1.0devel6

Corrected debug statements in main.cpp and added a bit of verbiage to the
   help text.
Removed hard coding of provider types in the QgisApp::addVectorLayer method.
  Caller must now provide compatible arguments that the designated provider can
  use to open the data store and fetch data. Changed QgsPgGeoprocessing class
  to properly call addVectorLayer.
<P></P>
2004-02-27 [ts]
Changed cl parser to getopt
   Moved project loading out of loop that loads layers - you now need to specify
   --project filename to load a filename. This ensures that you only try to load 
   one project file.
   Added --snapshot filename parameter that will load layers and project files
   specified, take a screenie of the map view and save it to disk as filename - 
   this is under construction still.
   Added saveMapAsImage(QString) to qgisapp so above cl option can be used.
<P></P>
2004-02-26 [ts]

<P>
July 20, 2002
  Repaint automatic for layers.
</P>
<P>
July 18, 2002
  Point, line and polygon PostGis layers can be drawn. Still issues with
  map exent and positioning of layers on the canvas. Drawing is manual and
  not tied to the paint event. No zooming or panning yet.

  the rendering code is currently disabled and being reorganized. So if
  you add a layer, nothing will be drawn...
