= Debug output and running tests =

If you are interested in seeing embedded debug output, change the following
CMake option:

```
-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG (or RELWITHDEBINFO)
```

This will flood your terminal or system log with lots of useful output from
QgsDebugMsg() calls in source code.

If you would like to run the test suite, you will need to do so from the build
directory, as it will not work with the installed/bundled app. First set the
CMake option to enable tests:

```
-D ENABLE_TESTS=TRUE
```

Then run all tests from build directory:

```
cd build
make test
```

To run all tests and report to http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS

```
cd build
make Experimental
```

You can define the host name reported via 'make Experimental' by setting a CMake
option:

```
-D SITE="my.domain.org"
```

To run specific test(s) (see 'man ctest'):

```
cd build
# show listing of tests, without running them
ctest --show-only

# run specific C++ or Python test(s) matching a regular expression
ctest --verbose --tests-regex SomeTestName
```
