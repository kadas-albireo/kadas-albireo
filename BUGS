Known issues and bugs in this release (QGIS 0.1pre1 'Moroz')
RASTER:

VECTOR:
1. OGR layers (for example shapefiles) do not reliably select or identify
   features. Any feature that intersects the MBR (minimum bounding rectangle)
   of the selection rectangle will be returned. This results in more features
   being returned than desired.
2. Zooming in very close can result in a scrambled display.
3. Drawing polygons with patterns other than solid may leave "holes" where the
   polygons are not properly rendered.
