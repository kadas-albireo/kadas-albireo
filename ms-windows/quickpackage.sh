# This script is just for if you want to run the nsis (under linux) part 
# of the package building process. Typically you should use 
#
# osgeo4w/creatensis.pl
#
# rather to do the complete package build process. However running this 
# script can be useful if you have manually tweaked the package contents 
# under osgeo4w/unpacked and want to create a new package based on that.
