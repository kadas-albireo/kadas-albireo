This FreeSans Gnu font has been stripped down to a minimum of characters,
just matching basic ISO 8859-1 Latin 1 (Western). See FreeSansQGIS-chars.png.

The family name has been set to FreeSansQGIS so as to never conflict with any
other installed font on the user's system, when loaded into QFontDatabase.

DO NOT INSTALL THIS FONT ON YOUR SYSTEM.
It is intended to be loaded by Qt on-the-fly during tests.
