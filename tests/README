Running tests
=============

You can run all tests using "make check".

Individual tests can be run using ctest.
For example if the output of "make check" ends like this:

   The following tests FAILED:
         77 - PyQgsLocalServer (Failed)

You could re-run the failing test with:

   ctest -V -R PyQgsLocalServer
