QGIS Change Log
ChangeLog,v 1.84 2004/05/19 06:10:24 gsherman Exp
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.3 'Madison' .... development version

2004-05-18 [gsherman] 0.2.0devel26
** Saved the qgsappbase.ui and the qgsprojectpropertiesbase.ui files (modified
at version 0.2.0devel25) using qt designer 3.1.2 to preserve backward
compatibility.

2004-05-18 [gsherman] 0.2.0devel25
** Changes to implement scale display for map data in feets, meters, and
decimal degrees. A new menu item is added to the Tools menu for selecting
the map units. This setting is currently not saved with a project file.
TODO:Modify qgis.dtd and project save/load to support map units.

NOTE - the qgisapp.ui file was created with qt 3.3.x and WILL NOT WORK
with qt 3.1.2. This will be changed as soon as I can find my 3.1.2 version
of qt designer...

2004-05-18 [ts] 0.2.0devel24
** Relax checking of raster filetype extensions to cater for filetypes where
extension is unpredictable (e.g. grass).
Now I use gdal to quickly check if a file is useable so pretty much anything
gdal iscompile with should get through if you have chosen wildcard
 filter in add raster dialog.
 
2004-05-17 [larsl] 0.2.0devel23
** Added URL parsing and attribute fields for route and track GPX layers

2004-05-17 [ts] 0.2.0devel22
** Added support to Save As Image to save in any QImageIO supported format.
File->SaveAsImage dialog filter list now generated automagically by
interrogating QImageIO for its supportted formats. File->SaveAsImage remembers
last dir used (stored in qsettings). Its supposed to remember last filter used
but there is an issue with that that needs to be resolved.

2004-05-16 [larsl] 0.2.0devel21
** Added url/link parsing to the GPX provider

2004-05-16 [larsl] 0.2.0devel20
** Corrected file name extension for PNG files

2004-05-15 [larsl] 0.2.0devel19
** Added my picture in the About dialog to attract more female users to QGIS

2004-05-13 [ts] 0.2.0devel18
** Raster properties changes: Switched order of general tab and symbology tab - as you normally change
straight to symbology tab anyway. Removed stats tab and consolidated stats
into metadata tab. Clean ups on metadata tab.

2004-05-13 [ts] 0.2.0devel17
** Raster stats tab now displays pyramid/overview info

2004-05-14 [larsl] 0.2.0devel16
** Cleaned up the enabling/disabling of controls in the GPS dialog
** Changed the order in which different layers are loaded from a GPX file
** Added the basename of the GPX or LOC file in the layer name
** Changed the plugin name to the more general "GPS Tools"

2004-05-14 [larsl] 0.2.0devel15
** Fixed a bug that caused the canvas to have a fixed width of 400 with my
   Qt version - the main grid layout for the main window had one extra column

2004-05-14 [larsl] 0.2.0devel14
** Added a tab for loading GPX and LOC files to the GPS plugin dialog

2004-05-14 [larsl] 0.2.0devel13
** Added a virtual destructor to QgsDataProvider and deleted dataProvider in
   the destructor for QgsVectorLayer

2004-05-13 [larsl] 0.2.0devel12
Changing std::string to QString in GPSData::getData() and GPSData::releaseData() to support Qt libraries built without STL support

2004-05-13 [ts] 0.2.0devel11
** Fixes for segfaults on grid_make and gps_importer dbf creation

2004-05-12 [gsherman] 0.2.0devel10
** Fixes for OS X endian bug (needs further testing)

2004-05-12 [jobi] 0.2.0devel9
** Added endian checks in configure
** decreased versions in the auto* checks

2004-05-12 [ts] 0.2.0devel8
** Added addProject(QString) to plugin interface.

2004-05-05 [jobi] 0.2.0devel7
** Extended qgis-config to expose version

2004-05-04 [ts] 0.2.0devel6
** Added two new internal plugins - North Arrow and Copyright message overlay

2004-05-03 [ts] 0.2.0devel5
** Canvas now emits renderComplete signal when rendering of cnavas has completed,
but before the screen is refreshed. Added accessor and mutators for the canvas
pixmap.

2004-05-03 [ts] 0.2.0devel4
** qgisApp->mapCanvas is now exposed through the plugin interface.

2004-05-03 [ts] 0.2.0devel3
**Added three new widgets to status bar:
scale - which shows the scale in the form 1:50000 *
coordinates - shows coordinates of mouse on map in its own widget
progressbar - shows the progress of any task that emits signals connected to
showProgress slot

**Added signal / slot mechanism for showExtents and set fp precision to 2 (see
below)

** stringRep function in QgsRect and QgsPoint now overloaded to allow setting
floating point precision for display. QgisApp & canvas are currently hard
coding this to 2 but I plan to make this user configurable in the options
panel.

**Added example of using progress indicator to raster stats gathering procedure.
You can see this in action by setting ak_shade example dataset to singleband
pseudocolor and you will see progress indicator advancing as stats are
gathered.

*NOTE: scale calculations may not be correct at this point - they are still
under development.

2004-04-27 [ts] 0.2.0devel2

** Added preliminary support for building pyramids in raster files
using the GDAL overview function. Currently it is hard coded to use Nearest
neighbour algorithm with pyramids at levels  2, 4 and 8. Adding pyramids to
your raster layer can greatly improve rendering performance. This new
functionality is accessed by right clicking on a raster legen entry and
choosing 'Build Pyramids' from the popup menu.

*** PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION ***
This current implementation does not warn you of possible side effects
including:
- possible image degradation if too many pyramids are generated
- possuble large increase in image side
- currently this process IS NOT KNOWN TO BE REVERSIBLE so please backup data
first before experimenting.

2004-04-27 [ts] 0.2.0devel1

** Rejigged single marker symbol so directory, icon selector, preview and 
   scaling widget are all in one panel rather than having to spawn a new
   window to select an icon.

2004-04-27 [ts] 0.2.0devel0

** Fixed broken bits in internal plugin builder template and updated default
   plugin template gui,

Version 0.2 'Pumpkin' .... development version

2004-04-25 [jobi] 0.1.0devel36
** Added i18n tools to EXTRA_DIST
** Updated German translation
** fixed a typo -> other translations changed too

2004-04-22 [jobi] 0.1.0devel35
** added install routine for svg files
** added new translations
** adjusted paths in the cpp files

2004-04-19 [jobi] 0.1.0devel34
** Changed to simple macros for detecting QT and GDAL
** Added code for detecting QGIS as m4 file to tools
** this will be installed together with QT and GDAL detection to
   $prefix/share/aclocal/qgis.m4
   so the plugins can just use those simple unique macros
** updated German translation
!! Developers have to link the installed qgis.m4 to /usr/share/aclocal/
!! or where ever aclocal keeps the m4 files
!! otherwise it's not detected by the plugins autogen.sh (more exactly
!! aclocal)
!! It can be cheated by adding -I path/to/qgis.m4 to the aclocal of
!! autogen.sh. But be carefull not to commit that to CVS

2004-04-18 [jobi] 0.1.0devel33
** Added internationalisations stuff
   Needs some documentation and more translations :-)

2004-04-17 [ts] 0.1.0devel32
** Fix for crash when opening singleband grayscale images introduced by Steves

** Bug fix (still unconfirmed if it cures the bug!) for raster layer rendering
artifacts.

** Added new color ramper for grayscale and pseudcolor grayscale image called
freak out (its a bit psycadellic at the moment). Last class break ne
eds some work!

2004-04-02 [jobi] 0.1.0devel27
** Added version checks for autoconf, automake and libtool                                                                                                     
** Small bugfixes                                                                                                                                       

2004-04-02 [mcoletti] 0.1.0devel26

  $(prefix)/lib
** "src/Makefile" no longer relies on explicit dependencies and uses better
  naming scheme for created source files

2004-03-21 [ts] 0.1.0devel7

** Added thumbnail preview of raster to raster props dialog.
   Added drawThumbnail method to rasterlayer.cpp
   Split (overloaded) draw method in rasterlayer.cpp so that some parts of
   the original draw method could be used by drawThumbnail method too.

** Fixed a bug in the drawing of pseudocolor single band grayscale images that
   prevented all class breaks being displayed.

  	
2004-03-10 [gs] 0.1.0devel7
** Added delimited text plugin which provides gui to add delimited text
   layers using the delimited_text data provider
** Changes to delimited_text data provider to support zooming, display
   of attributes, and identifying features. Selecting features does
   not work at this time.
** Auto* changes to support building the delimited text provider and
   plugin
** Minor changes to QgsFeature

2004-03-06 [ts] 0.1.0devel6
** Completed session management of plugins (so active plugins are remembered
   when qgis closes and reloaded in the next session).

2004-03-06 [ts] 0.1.0devel6
** Save state of plugins in ~/.qt/qtrc file (in progress). State is saved,
   just need to implement code to load plugins marked as active during
   application startup.

2004-03-06 [ts] 0.1.0devel6
** Added QgsRasterLayer::filterLayer which gets called near the end of each of
   the 8 renderers. This is the place to inline filters. Note that eventually filters 
   will be hived out to a filter plugin mechanism.

2004-03-06 [didge] 0.1.0devel6
** Changed configure stuff to write DEFINES in config.h.
   Postgresql stuff needs testing as I commented the compileflags in src/Makefile.am
** Infos will be posted on the devel mailinglist

2004-03-04 [ts] 0.1.0devel5
** Added option to options dialog to disable splashscreen.

2004-02-28 [ts] 0.1.0devel5
** --snapshot command line parameter working now and correctly scaling
   snapshot to size of pixmap.
** started moving splashscreen to a global so other classes diring  the startup 
   process can get access to set the splash status. (in progress)

2004-02-28 [gs] 0.1.0devel5
** Refactored QgsField to use new coding conventions
** Documented QgsField (added docs to qgsfield.h)
** Updated doxygen mainpage section in qgis.h
** Added Whats this? help to main application window
** Added providers/delimitedtext and associated source files to CVS

2004-02-27 [gs] 0.1.0devel4
** Corrected debug statements in main.cpp and added a bit of verbiage to the
   help text.
** Removed hard coding of provider types in the QgisApp::addVectorLayer method.
  Caller must now provide compatible arguments that the designated provider can
  use to open the data store and fetch data. Changed QgsPgGeoprocessing class
  to properly call addVectorLayer.

2004-02-27 [ts]
** Changed cl parser to getopt
   Moved project loading out of loop that loads layers - you now need to specify
   --project filename to load a filename. This ensures that you only try to load 
   one project file.
   Added --snapshot filename parameter that will load layers and project files
   specified, take a screenie of the map view and save it to disk as filename - 
   this is under construction still.
   Added saveMapAsImage(QString) to qgisapp so above cl option can be used.
 
2004-02-26 [ts]
** Added a tab to raster layer properties dialog to show metadata about the
   raster layer (using gdal metadata)

2004-02-26 [gs] 0.1.0devel3

July 26, 2002
	Drawing code now properly displays layers and calculates extents when
	zooming. Zoom is still fixed zoom in rather than interactive.
	
July 20, 2002
	Repaint automatic for layers.
	
July 18, 2002
	Point, line and polygon PostGis layers can be drawn. Still issues with
	map exent and positioning of layers on the canvas. Drawing is manual and
	not tied to the paint event. No zooming or panning yet.
	
July 10, 2002
	Layers can be selected and added to the map canvas collection however
	the rendering code is currently disabled and being reorganized. So if
	you add a layer, nothing will be drawn...
	
July 6, 2002
	This code is preliminary and really has no true functionality other than
	the ability to define a PostGIS connection and display the spatially enabled
	tables that could be loaded. 

	This is the initial import of the code base into CVS on Sourceforge.net.
