Version 0.2 'Pumpkin' .... development version

2004-03-06 [didge] 0.1.0devel6
** Changed configure stuff to write DEFINES in config.h.
   Postgresql stuff needs testing as I commented the compileflags in src/Makefile.am
** Infos will be posted on the devel mailinglist

2004-03-04 [ts] 0.1.0devel5
** Added option to options dialog to disable splashscreen.

2004-02-28 [ts] 0.1.0devel5
** --snapshot command line parameter working now and correctly scaling
   snapshot to size of pixmap.
** started moving splashscreen to a global so other classes diring  the startup 
   process can get access to set the splash status. (in progress)

2004-02-28 [gs] 0.1.0devel5
** Refactored QgsField to use new coding conventions
** Documented QgsField (added docs to qgsfield.h)
** Updated doxygen mainpage section in qgis.h
** Added Whats this? help to main application window
** Added providers/delimitedtext and associated source files to CVS

2004-02-27 [gs] 0.1.0devel4
** Corrected debug statements in main.cpp and added a bit of verbiage to the
   help text.
** Removed hard coding of provider types in the QgisApp::addVectorLayer method.
  Caller must now provide compatible arguments that the designated provider can
  use to open the data store and fetch data. Changed QgsPgGeoprocessing class
  to properly call addVectorLayer.

2004-02-27 [ts]
** Changed cl parser to getopt
   Moved project loading out of loop that loads layers - you now need to specify
   --project filename to load a filename. This ensures that you only try to load 
   one project file.
   Added --snapshot filename parameter that will load layers and project files
   specified, take a screenie of the map view and save it to disk as filename - 
   this is under construction still.
   Added saveMapAsImage(QString) to qgisapp so above cl option can be used.
 
2004-02-26 [ts]
** Added a tab to raster layer properties dialog to show metadata about the
   raster layer (using gdal metadata)

2004-02-26 [gs] 0.1.0devel3
** Added Version to configure.in. QGIS now displays its version number based on
   the settings in configure.in

2004-02-24 [gs]
** Search radius for identifying features on vector layers added to Preferences

2004-02-23 [ts]
** Save current view to disk as a PNG image

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1 'Moroz' February 25, 2004
**User interface improvements - menu and dialog cleanups and a new icon theme
  based on Everaldo's Crystal icon set.
**QGIS can load layers and / or a project on start up by specifying these
  on the command line.
**Symbol renderers for simple, graduated, and continous symbols
**Raster support for most GDAL formats
**Raster implementation supports a variety of rendering settings including
  semi transparent overlays, pallette inversion, flexible band to colour mapping
  in multiband images and creation of pseudocolor.

  types can be supported by writing a provider plugin
**Buffer plugin for PostGIS layers

  PostgreSQL/PostGIS

July 26, 2002
	Drawing code now properly displays layers and calculates extents when
	zooming. Zoom is still fixed zoom in rather than interactive.
	
July 20, 2002
	Repaint automatic for layers.
	
July 18, 2002
	Point, line and polygon PostGis layers can be drawn. Still issues with
	map exent and positioning of layers on the canvas. Drawing is manual and
	not tied to the paint event. No zooming or panning yet.
	
July 10, 2002
	Layers can be selected and added to the map canvas collection however
	the rendering code is currently disabled and being reorganized. So if
	you add a layer, nothing will be drawn...
	
July 6, 2002
	This code is preliminary and really has no true functionality other than
	the ability to define a PostGIS connection and display the spatially enabled
	tables that could be loaded. 

	This is the initial import of the code base into CVS on Sourceforge.net.
