TODO List for getting to version 0.1 (in no order of importance)
 1. Fix QgsProjectIo so that qgis projects can be saved and loaded. Major areas
    needing attention are customized raster settings and symbology for vector
    layers.
 2. Plugin manager needs to track which plugins are already loaded and allow
    user to unload a plugin from the plugin manager dialog.
 3. DONE (TS): Raster legend items need to be fixed to properly display raster name and
    a suitable pixmap.  Will improve later.
 4. DONE (TS/GS) Implement context menus for raster and vector layers. This is partially
    done for vector layers but needs more work to adjust the menu based on
    the vector layer types. Will add advanced functions later.
 5. Toolbar buttons related to layer functions need to be disabled when not
    appropriate (eg. table and select buttons when a raster is selected in 
    the legend)
 6. SPIT integration needs to be completed. The libpq++ dependency must be
    removed and the current open bugs (sf.net) need to be resolved.
 7. Adjust the open dialog for "shapefiles" to allow other formats supported
    by OGR.
 8. DONE (TS): Move the "All rasters" filter to the top of the rasters 
    open dialog. 
 9. DONE (TS): Remove *.adf from all rasters filter 
10. Add options dialog to store user preferences.
11. Add Help (HTML opened in user specified browser)
12. DONE (TS): Modify cursors so the black cursor / transparency bounndaries are bordered with a 
    1 pixel wide white border (to prevent losing the cursor over all black image regions. 
13. Update file open boxes to remember the last filter used in that session.
14. Add vector of view extents and replace the Previous Extent function with
    Forward and Back view buttons to allow user to move back and forth between
    views.
15. Prompt user to save / are you sure before opening a new project and losing everything in the 
    current one.
16. The geoprocessing menu, having the remove plugin option there does not make sense to me - it is 
    better managed by your nice plugin manager - otherwise if you have more then one geoprocessing 
    plugin  that menu will be very cluttered.   
17. Can the loaded plugin list be remebered from one session to the next?
18. The postgres vector layer dialog, could it automatically do the connect and show list of layers?
19. The postgres vector layer dialog, could you make it that double clicking a layer loads it?
20. When loading a pg layer, can you make the default name just the table name and show schema and 
    geom stuff in properties box only?
21. Can you upper case the first letter of a name in the legend ( for all layer types - perhaps we can 
    do this at qgsmaplayer.cpp)
22. On the properrties dialog for pg layer, can you make an apply button or wait cursor or progress bar. 
    The gui is currently quite unresponsive when changing the layer type.
23. Go through all dialogs and neaten up field labels to mixed case - e.g. on symbolisation dialog for vectors

For version 0.2
1. PostgreSQL/PostGIS layer management plugin (create/delete layers)
