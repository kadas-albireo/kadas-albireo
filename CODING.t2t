= QGIS Coding Standards =


These standards should be followed by all QGIS developers.

== Classes ==
=== Names ===
Class in QGIS begin with Qgs and are formed using mixed case. 
```
Examples:
	QgsPoint
	QgsMapCanvas
	QgsRasterLayer
```

=== Members ===
Class member names begin with a lower case ''m'' and are formed using mixed case.
```
	mMapCanvas	
	mCurrentExtent
```

All class members should be private.
'''Public class members are STRONGLY discouraged'''
=== Accessor Functions ===
Class member values should be obtained through accesssor functions. The function should be named without a ''get'' prefix. Accessor functions for the two private members above would be: 
```
	mapCanvas()
	currentExtent()
```

=== Functions ===
Function names begin with a lowercase letter and are formed using mixed case. The function name should convey something about the purpose of the function.
```
	updateMapExtent()
	setUserOptions()
```

== Qt Designer ==
=== Generated Classes ===
QGIS classes that are generated from Qt Designer (ui) files should have a ''Base'' suffix. This identifies the class as a generated base class.
```
Examples:
	QgsPluginMangerBase
	QgsUserOptionsBase
```
=== Dialogs ===
All dialogs should implement the following:
 * Tooltip help for all toolbar icons and other relevant widgets
 * WhatsThis help for '''all''' widgets on the dialog
 * An optional (though highly recommended) context sensitive ''Help'' button that directs the user to the appropriate help page by launching their web browser
== C++ Files ==
=== Names ===
C++ implementation and header files should be have a .cpp and .h extension respectively.
Filename should be all lowercase and, in the case of classes, match the class name.
```
Example:
	Class QgsFeatureAttribute source files are 
		qgsfeatureattribute.cpp and qgsfeatureattribute.h
```

=== Standard Header and License ===
Each source file should contain a header section patterned after the following example:
```
/***************************************************************************
    qgsfield.cpp - Describes a field in a layer or table
     --------------------------------------
    Date                 : 01-Jan-2004
    Copyright            : (C) 2004 by Gary E.Sherman
    Email                : sherman at mrcc.com
/***************************************************************************
 *                                                                         *
 *   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify  *
 *   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by  *
 *   the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or     *
 *   (at your option) any later version.                                   *
 *                                                                         *
 ***************************************************************************/
```

=== CVS Keyword ===
Each source file should contain the $Id$ keyword. This will be expanded by CVS to contain useful information about the file, revision, last committer, and date/time of last checkin.

Place the keyword right after the standard header/license that is found at the top of each source file:
```
	/* $Id$ */
```

== Variable Names ==
Variable names begin with a lower case letter and are formed using mixed case.
```
Examples:
	mapCanvas
	currentExtent
```

== Editing ==
Any text editor/IDE can be used to edit QGIS code, providing the following requirements are met.

=== Tabs ===
Set your editor to emulate tabs with spaces. Tab spacing should be set to 2 spaces.

=== Indentation ===
Source code should be indented to improve readability. There is a .indent.pro file in the QGIS src directory that contains the switches to be used when indenting code using the GNU indent program. If you don't use GNU indent, you should emulate these settings.

=== Braces ===
Braces should start on the line following the expression:
```
	if(foo == 1)
	{
	  // do stuff
	  ...
 	}else
	{
	  // do something else
	  ...
	}
```


== Coding Style ==

Here are described some programming hints and tips that will hopefully reduce errors, development time, and maintenance.


=== Where-ever Possible Generalize Code ===
```
If you are cut-n-pasting code, or otherwise writing the same thing more than once, consider consolidating the code 
into a single function.
``` 

This will:
  * allow changes to be made in one location instead of in multiple places
  * help prevent code bloat
  * make it more difficult for multiple copies to evolve differences over time, thus making it harder to understand and 
maintain for others

=== Prefer Having Constants First in Predicates ===

Prefer to put constants first in predicates. 
```
"0 == value" instead of "value == 0"
```

This will help prevent programmers from accidentally using "=" when they meant to use "==", which can introduce very subtle 
logic bugs.  The compiler will generate an error if you accidentally use "=" instead of "==" for comparisons since constants 
inherently cannot be assigned values.

=== Whitespace Can Be Your Friend ===

Adding spaces between operators, statements, and functions makes it easier for humans to parse code.


Which is easier to read, this:

```
if (!a&&b)
```

or this:

```
if ( ! a && b )
```

=== Add Trailing Identifying Comments ===

Adding comments at the end of function, struct and class implementations makes it easier to find them later.


Consider that you're at the bottom of a source file and need to find a very long function -- without these kinds of trailing 
comments you will have to page up past the body of the function to find its name.  Of course this is ok if you wanted to find 
the beginning of the function; but what if you were interested at code near its end?  You'd have to page up and then back down 
again to the desired part.

E.g.,

``` 
void foo::bar()
{ 
    // ... imagine a lot of code here 
 } // foo::bar()
```


=== Use Braces Even for Single Line Statements ===

Using braces for code in if/then blocks or similar code structures even for single line statements means that adding another 
statement is less likely to generate broken code.


Consider:

``` 
  if (foo)
    bar();
 else
    baz();
```

Adding code after bar() or baz() without adding enclosing braces would create broken code.  Though most programmers would 
naturally do that, some may forget to do so in haste.

So, prefer this:

``` 
 if (foo)
 {
   bar();
 }
 else
 { 
    baz();
 } 
```

= SVN Access =

This page describes how to get started using the QGIS Subversion repository

== Accessing the Repository ==
To check out QGIS HEAD:
```
  svn --username [your user name] co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis
```


== Anonymous Access ==
You can use the following commands to perform an anonymous checkout from the QGIS Subversion repository. 
Note we recommend checking out the trunk (unless you are a developer or really HAVE to have the latest 
changes and dont mind lots of crashing!).

You must have a subversion client installed prior to checking out the code. See the Subversion website 
for more information. The Links page contains a good selection of SVN clients for various platforms.

To check out a branch
```
  svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/branches/<branch name>
```
To check out SVN stable trunk:
```
  svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis qgis_unstable
```

/!\ '''Note:''' If you are behind a proxy server, edit your ~/subversion/servers file to specify 
your proxy settings first!

/!\ '''Note:''' In QGIS we keep our most stable code in trunk. Periodically we will tag a release 
off trunk, and then continue stabilisation and selective incorporation of new features into trunk.

See the INSTALL file in the source tree for specific instructions on building development versions. 

== QGIS documentation sources ==

If you're interested in checking out Quantum GIS documentation sources:
```
  svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis_docs/trunk qgis_docs
```

You can also take a look at DocumentationWritersCorner for more information.
 
== Documentation ==
The repository is organized as follows:

http://wiki.qgis.org/images/repo.png

See the Subversion book http://svnbook.red-bean.com for information on becoming a SVN master.




== Development in branches ==

=== Purpose ===
The complexity of the QGIS source code has increased considerably during the last years. Therefore it is hard 
to anticipate the side effects that the addition of a feature will have. In the past, the QGIS project had very 
long release cycles because it was a lot of work to reetablish the stability of the software system after new 
features were added. To overcome these problems, QGIS switched to a development model where new features are 
coded in svn branches first and merged to trunk (the main branch) when they are finished and stable. This section 
describes the procedure for branching and merging in the QGIS project.

 
=== Procedure ===
 * Initial announcement on mailing list
Before starting, make an announcement on the developer mailing list to see if another developer is 
already working on the same feature. Also contact the technical advisor of the project steering committee 
(PSC). If the new feature requires any changes to the QGIS architecture, a request for comment (RFC) is needed. 
 * Create a branch
Create a new svn branch for the development of the new feature (see UsingSubversion for the svn syntax). Now 
you can start developing.
 * Merge from trunk regularly
It is recommended to merge the changes in trunk to the branch on a regular basis. This makes it easier to merge 
the branch back to trunk later.
 * Documentation on wiki
It is also recommended to document the intended changes and the current status of the work on a wiki page.
 * Testing before merging back to trunk
When you are finished with the new feature and happy with the stability, make an announcement on the developer list. 
Before merging back, the changes will be tested by developers and users. Binary packages (especially for OsX and Windows) 
will be generated to also involve non-developers. In trac, a new Component will be opened to file tickets against. 
Once there are no remaining issues left, the technical advisor of the PSC merges the changes into trunk.

=== Creating a branch ===

We prefer that new feature developments happen out of trunk so that trunk remains in a 
stable state. To create a branch use the following command:

```
svn copy https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/branches/qgis_newfeature
svn commit -m "New feature branch"
```

=== Merge regularly from trunk to branch ===

When working in a branch you should regularly merge trunk into it so that your branch does not diverge more 
than necessary. In the top level dir of your branch, first type ```svn info``` to determine the revision 
numbers of your branch which will produce output something like this:

```
timlinux@timlinux-desktop:~/dev/cpp/qgis_raster_transparency_branch$ svn info
Caminho: .
URL: https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/branches/raster_transparency_branch
Raiz do Repositório: https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis
UUID do repositório: c8812cc2-4d05-0410-92ff-de0c093fc19c
Revisão: 6546
Tipo de Nó: diretório
Agendado: normal
Autor da Última Mudança: timlinux
Revisão da Última Mudança: 6495
Data da Última Mudança: 2007-02-02 09:29:47 -0200 (Sex, 02 Fev 2007)
Propriedades da Última Mudança: 2007-01-09 11:32:55 -0200 (Ter, 09 Jan 2007)
```

The second revision number shows the revision number of the start revision of your branch and the first the 
current revision. You can do a dry run of the merge like this:

```
svn merge --dry-run -r 6495:6546 https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis
```

After you are happy with the changes that will be made do the merge for real like this:

```
svn merge -r 6495:6546 https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis
svn commit -m "Merged upstream changes from trunk to my branch"
```


== Submitting Patches ==

There are a few guidelines that will help you to get your patches into QGIS easily, and help us 
deal with the patches that are sent to use easily.

=== Patch file naming ===

If the patch is a fix for a specific bug, please name the file with the bug number in it e.g. 
'''bug777fix.diff''', and attach it to the original bug report in trac (https://svn.qgis.org/trac).

If the bug is an enhancement or new feature, its usually a good idea to create a ticket in 
trac (https://svn.qgis.org/trac) first and then attach you 

=== Create your patch in the top level QGIS source dir ===

This makes it easier for us to apply the patches since we don't need to navigate to a specific 
place in the source tree to apply the patch. Also when I receive patches I usually evaluate them 
using kompare, and having the patch from the top level dir makes this much easier. Below is an 
example of you you can include multiple changed files into your patch from the top level directory:

```
cd qgis
svn diff src/ui/somefile.ui src/app/somefile2.cpp > bug872fix.diff
```

=== Including non version controlled files in your patch ===

If your improvements include new files that don't yet exist in the repository, you should indicate 
to svn that they need to be added before generating your patch e.g.

```
cd qgis
svn add src/lib/somenewfile.cpp
svn diff > bug7887fix.diff
```

=== Getting your patch noticed ===

QGIS developers are busy folk. We do scan the incoming patches on bug reports but sometimes we miss things. 
Don't be offended or alarmed. Try to identify a developer to help you - using the ["Project Organigram"] and 
contact them asking them if they can look at your patch. If you dont get any response, you can escalate your 
query to one of the Project Steering Committee members (contact details also available on the ["Project Organigram"]).

=== Due Diligence ===

QGIS is licensed under the GPL. You should make every effort to ensure you only submit patches which are 
unencumbered by conflicting intellectual property rights. Also do not submit code that you are not happy to 
have made available under the GPL.



== Obtaining SVN Write Access ==

Write access to QGIS source tree is by invitation. Typically when a person submits several (there is no fixed 
number here) substantial patches that demonstrate basic competance and understanding of C++ and QGIS coding 
conventions, one of the PSC members or other existing developers can nominate that person to the PSC for granting 
of write access. The nominator should give a basic promotional paragraph of why they think that person should gain 
write access. In some cases we will grant write access to non C++ developers e.g. for translators and documentors. 
In these cases, the person should still have demonstrated ability to submit patches and should ideally have submtted 
several substantial patches that demonstrate their understanding of modifying the code base without breaking things, etc.



=== Procedure once you have access ===


Checkout the sources:

```
svn co https://svn.qgis.org/repos/qgis/trunk/qgis qgis
```


Build the sources (see INSTALL document for proper detailed instructions)

```
cd qgis
mkdir build
ccmake ..    (set your preferred options)
make
make install  (maybe you need to do with sudo / root perms)
```

Make your edits

```
cd ..
```

Make your changes in sources. Always check that everything compiles before making any commits.
Try to be aware of possible breakages your commits may cause for people building on other 
platforms and with older / newer versions of libraries.


Add files (if you added any new files). The svn status command can be used to quickly see 
if you have added new files.

```
svn status src/pluguns/grass/modules
```

Files listed with ? in front are not in SVN and possibly need to be added by you:

```
svn add src/pluguns/grass/modules/foo.xml
```

Commit your changes

```
svn commit src/pluguns/grass/modules/foo.xml
```

Your editor (as defined in $EDITOR environment variable) will appear and you should make a
 comment at the top of the file (above the area that says 'dont change this'. Put a 
descriptive comment and rather do several small commits if the changes across a number of 
files are unrelated. Conversely we prefer you to group related changes into a single commit.

Save and close in your editor. The first time you do this, you should be prompted to 
put in your username and password. Just use the same ones as your trac account.
