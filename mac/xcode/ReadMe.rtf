This builds QGIS, as an alternative to the CLI Unix build (both build the Mac application).  By default everything is built for the native architecture.\
\
Dependent libraries are optionally copied into the application bundle and embedded library paths are adjusted.  Some dependent libraries are always copied for stability reasons (Qt, PyQt).\

\b \cf0 Configuration
\b0 \
\
Make a copy of the 
\f1\fs20 qgis_user-template.xcconfig
\f0\fs24  file, named 
\f1\fs20 qgis_user.xcconfig
\f0\fs24 .  You can also reuse a 
\f1\fs20 qgis_user.xcconfig
\f0\fs24  from an earlier version, to retain your own configuration, but make sure to check the template for any major changes.  
\i Make sure that the qgis_user.xcconfig exists before opening the project.
\i0 \
\
It is a plain text file, you can edit it in your favorite text editor before opening the project file, or within Xcode after opening the project.\
\
The xcconfig file is a simple text file with environment variables and values, and comments denoted by //.  Very important: # is not a comment character, and will break the config file if used.\
\
\pard\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\ql\qnatural\pardirnatural
\cf0 \ul Defaults\
\ulnone \
The default configuration is for the native architecture, without using a system SDK.  GDAL, PROJ, GEOS and SQLite frameworks are used.  Expat, Postgres and GSL are expected in default /usr/local builds.  GRASS support is from a GRASS-6.4.app application.  The python.org Python framework is used, even on Leopard.\
\
By default, Qt, GSL, the Postgres client library are bundled in the Qgis application.\
\
\ul Build\ulnone  - At the top are some basic build settings.\
\
\pard\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\ql\qnatural\pardirnatural

\f1\fs20 \cf0 SDKSYS
\f0\fs24  tells the project to use the 10.4 (tig) or 10.5 (leo) SDK.  This will also build Qgis in a subfolder of the build folder - this is handy if you want to build once for Tiger (python.org Python) and once for Leopard (system Python) without overwriting either.\
\
Note that there may be linking problems with the SDK for non-system libraries and frameworks.  This is because the linker prefixes everything with the SDKROOT and indirectly linked libraries in non-standard locations (ie /usr/local) may not be found.  If you encounter linking errors, you should add symlinks to the SDKROOT to those locations.\
\
For example, /usr/local:\
\

\f1\fs20 sudo ln -s /usr/local /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/local\
\pard\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\ql\qnatural\pardirnatural

\f0\fs24 \cf0 \
If there are subfolders involved that are not already in the SDK, add them first.  Say you have some libraries in /Users/Shared/unix:\
\
\pard\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\ql\qnatural\pardirnatural

\f1\fs20 \cf0 sudo mkdir -p /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/Users/Shared\
ln -s /Users/Shared/unix /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/Users/Shared/unix
\f0\fs24 \
\

\f1\fs20 ARCHS
\f0\fs24  is a list of which architectures to build, the default is the native arch of your Mac.  Uncomment the universal line if that's what you want.\

\cf0 \ul Misc Support\

\f1\fs20 \cf0 QTDIR
\f0\fs24  is where the Qt applications and plugins are installed.  
\f1\fs20 QTBIN
\f0\fs24  is where the Qt command-line programs are found.  The default is for a binary installation of Qt.  If built from source, you may need to change these.\
\

\f1\fs20 BISON
\f0\fs24  is the base path to Bison.  If building on Tiger (not 
\i on
\i0  Leopard 
\i for
\i0  Tiger), a user-built bison 2.3 is required.  Leopard has a usable bison.\
\

\f1\fs20 GPSBABEL
\f0\fs24  is the full path to the gpsbabel CLI program.  Used for bundling gpsbabel.\
\

\f1\fs20 SIP_system
\f0\fs24  is the full path to the sip program when installed for the system Python on Leopard.\
\
\

\cf0 \ul Library forms\ulnone  - this is where you tell the project what type of library you have, as many of them are available in framework forms as well as libraries.\
\
Most of them are a choice between 'fw' for framework and 'shared' or 'static' for a library.  See the comments in the xcconfig for details, and other possible choices.\
\
Frameworks are the easiest to configure - just set the option to 
\f1\fs20 fw
\f0\fs24 , and all PREFIX, INC and LIB options are set for you.  Frameworks assume either a system framework, or the framework is in 
\f1\fs20 /Library/Frameworks
\f0\fs24 .\
\
For library forms, the PREFIX (described later) defaults to 
\f1\fs20 /usr/local
\f0\fs24 .  If this is where your libraries are installed, setting the form to 
\f1\fs20 shared
\f0\fs24  or 
\f1\fs20 static
\f0\fs24  is all that's needed.\
\
The version for GRASS and Python can't be detected by the config file, so make sure these are correct.\
\
See detailed dependency notes below.\
\
\
\ul Bundle options\ulnone  - Some libraries and programs can be bundled in the Qgis.app package for a more portable Qgis.app.  These are pretty straightforward - yes or no.  At some time I will add more checking logic, but for now be explicit.  Generally, you don't need to bundle frameworks or system libraries.  The only logic checks whether the dynamic library or program exists, so it automatically excludes static libraries and frameworks, but it doesn't check whether it's a system library, so you could end up bundling libsqlite from the system.\
\
\ul Prefixes\ulnone  - If you have unix libraries installed in a location other than 
\f1\fs20 /usr/local
\f0\fs24 , the next section is where you can change those.  \ul Make sure to check these for any library forms\ulnone .\
\
\
\ul Notes for dependencies\ulnone \
\
- Postgres - An alternative to bundling Postgres is to build Qgis with a static libpq.  There are 
\f1\fs20 shared
\f0\fs24  and 
\f1\fs20 static
\f0\fs24  forms in the settings.\
\
- GRASS - GRASS.app \ul must\ulnone  be installed as it was built.  If it was moved or renamed after installation, GRASS support in Qgis won't work.  This goes for building Qgis as well as running it to use full GRASS support.\

\b \cf0 Extra Bundling
\b0 \
\
Other support items not needed by the standard Qgis build can be bundled for a custom Qgis build: extra plugins, libraries, frameworks, Python modules.  For example, some PyQt-based extra modules (ie Qwt5) are installed inside the PyQt folder, and these won't be found if they are not bundled with the Qgis copy of PyQt.\
\
Duplicate the file 
\f1\fs20 bundle-template.sh
\f0\fs24  with the name 
\f1\fs20 bundle.sh
\f0\fs24 .  Add needed copy and processing commands to this.  See the comments in 
\f1\fs20 bundle.sh
\f0\fs24  for details.  
\f1\fs20 bundle.sh
\f0\fs24  is meant to be reusable, just like 
\f1\fs20 qgis_user.xcconfig
\f0\fs24 .\
\
\

\b Build Targets

\cf0 \ul Full QGIS\ulnone   will build Qgis with Python support and all default and optional plugins.\
\
Xcode doesn't have a way to conditionally build targets, just code within sources (with standard macro switches).  It 
\i will
\i0  try to keep building as much as it can after errors.  The last target built is the Qgis application itself, which has all the bundling and cleanup steps.  So, if a dependency is missing for a plugin, it will have errors and fail to build, then the app bundling and cleanup will work with what succeeded.\
\
\ul Cleaning\ulnone  - to clean the project 
\b Clean All
\b0 .  This actually leaves qgsconfig.h and qgssvnversion.h in the build folder.\
\
For a complete clean, trash the build folder from the project folder (NOT from the project itself!).\
